Builder is probably the most advanced class to play in KAG. It's different from the other classes -- from a certain point of view, a Builder can do the most for their team out of all classes. It's mostly a tactical class, although having good reflexes will sometimes help you too; however, not as much muscle memory is needed as for the Knight class.

Although this guide is for everyone -- from newbies to players with some experience already -- it'd be good if you already completed the in-game Basics and Capture The Flag tutorials and knew the obvious stuff such as the controls and basic mechanics: mining, building, wallclimbing, changing class, picking up items etc.

The guide has a few chapters, which you can see and browse on the left part of the website.
