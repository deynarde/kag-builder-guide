<div id="the-builder-class" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The builder class</h2>
<p>There are three classes in KAG: the archer, the knight and the builder. Although a good team in Capture The Flag (CTF) should be mostly composed of knights, it's the builders who lead the team to victory. Out of 12 people in a full team, at least 3-4 should be builders.</p>
<p>As a builder in CTF, your role is to make defences for your flags and base, build shops for your teammates, as well as set up siege and help your team advance and destroy the opposing team's structures, and finally -- capture the enemy flag. You have plenty of tools for that, and winning the game by leading your team is basically your main focus as a builder.</p>
<p>In this chapter we're going to explain all the structures you can place and items you can use as a builder, as well as talk a bit about building a good base and a tower. We'll also highlight some common mistakes that inexperienced builders can make.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/smilingbob.png"></p>
</div>
<div id="getting-materials" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Getting materials</h2>
<p>It is mentioned in the in-game tutorial, but we'll mention it again. You can mine any blocks by holding the right mouse button. There are 2 natural blocks that don't give any materials -- bedrock and dirt.</p>
<p>Bedrock can't be destroyed at all.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/bedrock.png"></p>
<p>Dirt can be dug, but doesn't give any materials.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/dirt.png"></p>
<p>You can have up to 500 stone, 500 wood or 100 gold in one slot in your inventory (press F). You can take materials out of your inventory by clicking on them with your inventory open (or closing the inventory while your cursor is on one of the slots). Wood and stone are taken out in stacks or 250 (or less if you have less than 250- the first part you take out is the full stack) -- so to throw out 500 wood, you'll need to throw 250 wood two times. Gold is taken out in stacks of 50.</p>
<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/matthrow.webm" controls loop="loop" preload>
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>Materials such as stone and wood decay when outside of somebody's inventory or outside of a storage (just laying on the ground) after a few minutes. Gold does not.</p>
<div id="stone" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Stone</h3>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/stone.png"></p>
<p>Stone ore gives 4 stone per hit. Normal stone ores can be hit up to 6 times, so 24 stone per stone ore.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/thickstone.png"></p>
<p>Thick stone ore gives 6 stone per hit for 6 hits, then 4 stone per hit for remaining 5 hits. Gives a total of 56 stone after 11 hits.</p>
</div>
<div id="gold" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Gold</h3>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/gold.png"></p>
<p>Gold ore gives 4 gold per hit, can be hit up to 5 times -- 20 gold per gold ore.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>you can actually see gold ore</strong> on the map -- press M and look for orange spots, like in the images below.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/goldore1.png"></p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/goldore2.png"></p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/goldore3.png"></p>
</div>
<div id="wood" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Wood</h3>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tree.png"></p>
<p>Trees need between 10 and 12 hits to fall down and drop logs. Trees have varying height, even when they reach their maximum height, but pine trees of maximum height drop 6 or 7 logs, while the smaller, bushy trees drop 3, 4 or 5 logs.</p>
<p>One log gives <strong>10 wood per hit, 5 hits per log -- so up to 50 wood per a log.</strong></p>
<p>Trees of course can regrow after being chopped down. Although it also varies, it takes between 30 and 100 seconds, with bushy trees regrowing faster than pine trees.</p>
</div>
<div id="resupplies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Resupplies</h3>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/resupply.png"></p>
<p>This is an important mechanic that a lot of people overlook. During the building time (the first 180 seconds of a standard CTF match), you can get free materials from the tent or a builder shop every 40 seconds. <strong>You get 300 wood and 100 stone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In game time, you get 100 wood and 30 stone every 20 seconds.</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the materials stack, so if you were next to the tent for 60 seconds straight, you'd get 300 wood and 90 stone in game time. If you're staying in your base, it's good to constantly get resupplies -- it may not seem like much, but it adds up and you can eventually decently expand your base.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="your-building-menu" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Your building menu</h2>
<p>In this section we'll shortly describe each of the blocks in the builder menu, which you can access by pressing F. A builder's building menu consists of 11 blocks/structures, as you can see in the image below:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/buildermenu.png"></p>
<p>Blocks can cost either wood or stone.</p>
<p><strong>Placing blocks gives you coins</strong> - depending on what you're placing and if you're placing it during build time (the first 180 seconds where teams build their bases) or game time.</p>
<div id="stone-block" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Stone block</h3>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/bstone.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Costs 10 stone.</li>

<li>Can be destroyed by builders (7 hits), bombs (1 bomb if the bomb is next to the block) bomb arrows, kegs, mines.</li>
<li>Gives 1 stone per hit (7 stone total).</li>

<li>Can be destroyed by builders (5 hits), explosives (5 bombs per 1 stone door!).</li>
<li>Gives 5 stone per hit (25 stone total).</li>
<li>Strong block, especially against enemy knights. However, quite expensive, so don't overuse them.</li>
<li>Doors can only be opened by teammates.</li>
<li>Doors (both stone and wooden ones) should be placed next to a solid block, or else they will fall off after some time.</li>

For 1 heart of damage you can just place a spike right above somebody (0 tiles of distance), for 2 hearts -- 2 tiles, 3 hearts -- at least 4 tiles and for 4 hearts you need at least 7 tiles.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Workshops, items, siege</h2>
<p>After you place a workshop (150 wood), you can convert it to one of the 9 different shops. Most of them cost additional wood (converting an empty workshop to a new shop costs wood), but some cost stone and gold as well. In this section we'll talk about all the different shops and builder-related items and vehicles you can buy in them.</p>
<p>All enemies are also able to use your shops -- place them carefully.</p>

<li>Generates light.</li>
<li>1x1 size in inventory.</li>
<li>Can be turned on and off with Space button.</li>
<li>Lanterns don't work in water (they turn off by themselves), unless they're in your inventory.</li>

<li>You can press left mouse button while you have one in your hand to splash water. The water can extinguish fires, as well as extinguish a lit keg (which is unique for the water bucket -- water bombs or water arrows can't do that). Water buckets extinguish through walls as well. You can make up to 3 water splashes before the bucket becomes empty and requires refilling.</li>

<li>Builders (but not knights and archers) can use a drill by holding left mouse button while you have one in your hand. It destroys blocks much more quicker than if you were destroying them using pickaxe. The drill destroys 2 blocks in front of it.</li>
<li>Drills are aimed in the direction of your cursor.</li>
<li>The more blocks you destroy, the hotter the drill gets -- eventually it can overheat and deal you 0.25heart of damage and drop to the ground while releasing steam. If that happens, don't instantly try to pick it back up -- it will keep damaging you and dropping to the ground. You have to wait a few seconds.</li>

<li>As mentioned earlier, drills can be cooled down by using any kind of water on it (water bomb, water arrow or water bucket).

There's also a bar that shows you how heated a drill is.</li>

<li>Drills can be used to damage enemies in a situation like in the gif below (pay attention to what is a door and what is a normal block), while the knights can't damage you.

<li>If the bolts are upgraded, the ballista fires explosive bolts instead that damage structures too. However, it consumes 2 bolts instead of one (so if a ballista has 12 bolts, it actually only will shoot 6 explosive bolts). Explosive bolts instantly kill enemies as well.</li>

<li>If a ballista is flipped over due to a collapse or being driven away, it will be damaged and destroy itself after a few seconds. To prevent that, as soon as it flips over you should spam the &quot;Flip vehicle&quot; button that appears when you hold E, which should flip it back.</li>

<div id="building-a-base" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Building a base</h2>
<p>The build time is the <strong>first 180 seconds of the match</strong> with an uncrossable red zone in the middle. The point is to obviously build a decent base before you start fighting with the opposing teams. The more builders in a team know how to make good defences, the more likely it is that you're going to win (or at least lose slower).</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to, you can keep building the base after the build time ends. Often there's still lots of materials left, so you can keep improving the base.</p>
<div id="a-front-tower" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> A front tower</h3>
<p>Besides having your flags be well protected, having a decent tower is also very important. A good way to start building a front tower in 40 seconds is to build some ladders up, add some stone backwall and then build a <strong>builder shop</strong> like in the image below. Make sure to not place more than 10 ladders so that you have enough materials for a builder shop.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower1.png"></p>
<p>If you decide to focus on the tower for the entirety of the build time, you're most likely going to work around here. As mentioned earlier, the builder shop lets you get resupplies -- you should walk to one every 40 seconds (on around 140 seconds left, 100, 60 and 20) to get <strong>free 100 stone and 300 wood.</strong></p>
<p>Usually you end up using all the materials you have before the next resupply, so if that happens you should go dig some stone and return for the next batch of resupplies.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you can't make everything by yourself in an actual CTF match -- this is a team game after all, so other players should help you and also build a bit. You should pretty much build what is missing or improve the parts that could be better. This part will just tell you how a good tower should look like.</p>
<p>After building a builder shop, it's good to make the front wall. Usually making a 3 block thick wall is enough.</p>
<p>We start with placing 3 layers of doors at the bottom -- 5 wooden doors and 1 stone door. We don't want to place too many stone doors so that we have enough stone for the actual wall itself.</p>
<p>After placing the doors we place stone walls. <strong>Keep in mind you can actually place blocks in the red zone!</strong> Usually we build it like this:</p>
<p>First, the outer layer made out of stone only:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower2.png"></p>
<p>After that, the middle layer is going to be wood:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower3.png"></p>
<p>Replace every 4th or 5th wooden block with stone -- so that if the outer layer gets broken, the archers can't burn the entire middle layer at once:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower4.png"></p>
<p>And then the inner layer, stone only:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower5.png"></p>
<p>That's a solid front wall already. If you have some stone left, it'd be good to add some more backwalls so that the tower isn't too easy to collapse.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower6.png"></p>
<p>Okay, so we have a builder shop and a basic front wall. However, a good tower obviously has more.</p>
<p>It'd be good to have the most basic shops in a tower + a tunnel. It's good to have a tunnel above the builder shop, then a knight shop (close to the tunnel, because majority of your team should be knights) then an archer shop (on top, because that's where defensive archers can shoot from). A food shop could be useful as well.</p>
<p>Somewhat like this:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower7.png"></p>
<p>The empty shop is going to be a tunnel later -- we need to find some gold first.</p>
<p>It's good to have lots, <strong>lots of doors</strong> -- in case the enemies get into your tower, the enemy builders will usually not be able to block all the doors and your knights will be able to defeat them by using doors to their advantage. So it can look somewhat like this, with every shop having 6 sets of doors:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower8.png"></p>
<p>Next, you want to replace majority of the wooden backwalls from the shops and doors with stone backwalls. <strong>Fire spreads much slower and much less with stone backwalls than if there were wooden backwalls.</strong></p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower9.png"></p>
<p>Here's a comparison of using a fire arrow against a part of a tower, but one part has stone backwalls for doors and shops while one has wooden:</p>
<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/firecompar.webm" controls loop="loop" preload>
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>Obviously, you don't want the front wall to be thinner above. We build additional 3 layers of wooden doors next to every shop (again, the more doors there are -- the harder for enemy builders to block them all) and add stone.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower11.png"></p>
<p>The bottom could use some work too. Add some more doors and stone blocks, so that if the enemies get through the first set of doors they don't have too much space to fight, and so that the tower is harder to collapse.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower12.png"></p>
<p>Sometimes you can choose to add a bit of platforms somewhere too, for example on the top, so that defensive archers can be protected from enemy arrows. Stone backwall is advised again.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower13.png"></p>
<p>Adding a trampoline after the game starts (the red zone bounces it back) is also good.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tower14.png"></p>
<p>If you have wood left, you can place doors pretty much everywhere. The more doors the better.</p>
<p>Here's a 3 min video example of building a tower on public CTF along with some other people:</p>

</div>
<div id="flag-rooms" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Flag rooms</h3>
<p>Flag rooms should have at least 2 entrances, preferably 3, so that if one gets blocked you can still use the other ones -- one from the top and two from the sides, like this:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/flagroom.png"></p>
<p>Keep in mind that stone doors like that are enough; wooden doors are pretty powerful. You don't need to overuse stone doors.</p>
<p>The doors from the tent's side should be on floor level so that knights can quickly get there. However, the one on the right side -- from the enemy's side -- shouldn't be placed like that; worse players can sometimes open the entrance accidentally and die, letting enemies get into the flag room. Making the entrance not on floor level partially prevents this.</p>
<p>Of course, the thicker a flag room is, the better -- if you have lots of materials, you can make it as thick as you want. If you lose the flags you lose the game, after all.</p>
<p>However, if you're making it thicker, it's good to have some additional doors for easier movement.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/flagroom2.png"></p>
<p>It's also good to put a mine in each flag room (or even 2!). If any enemies eventually come to the flag, they will have to destroy the mine first and often they will just walk into it accidentally.</p>
</div>
<div id="tunnels" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span> Tunnels</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there should be a tunnel in your tower for quick travel. The first tunnel should be next to your tent (or at least close to it).</p>
<p>The tunnel near your tent <strong>should always have a sawtrap</strong>. A sawtrap like this -- team bridges, the tunnel on it and the saw under the team bridges.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/imog.png"></p>
<p>Here's how to build one:</p>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="tree-farm" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.4</span> Tree farm</h3>
<p>A tree farm is very useful to all the builders in your team -- it lets you get lots of wood easily, which also lets you get stone from quarries.</p>
<p>The idea is to place trees next to each other with 1 tile gaps, and have them be seperated like this:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/treefarm.png"></p>
<p>After that, you get a saw and put it like this.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/treefarm2.png"></p>
<p>Destroying the trees will now make all of the logs fall downwards instead of the tree falling to the side. The logs, when destroyed by the saw, are converted to wood. This is much quicker than if you were chopping them manually.</p>
<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/treefarm1.webm" controls loop="loop" preload>
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you have a bigger tree farm, you don't have to get another saw -- you can just move the saw around.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a saw, it's actually faster to chop down trees as a knight than as a builder -- a slash can damage 2 trees at once. So if the tree farm is near the tent you could quickly swap to knight to do that.</p>
<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/treefarm2.webm" controls loop="loop" preload>
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>Trees can grow on bedrock, dirt and stone, but they can't grow on man-made blocks like stone blocks or wood blocks.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/treegrow1.png"></p>
<p>Also, sometimes it may bug out and the logs may not fall through and instead get stuck on the top. I believe this doesn't happen as often if there's more blocks vertically seperating the trees, like in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/tree3blocks.png"></p>
<p>If for some reason the logs do not fall into the saw (or it was accidentally turned off), you can just throw the saw at the logs, like in the gif below.</p>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="shops" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.5</span> Shops</h3>
<p>It's good to have some shops outside of the tower too, in case the ones in the tower get destroyed. Usually you should have some near the tent.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/shops.png"></p>
<p>Make sure that you replace some of the wooden backwalls with stone backwalls so that it's not as easy to burn. Also, make sure they have good protection (doors) so that the enemies can't get in too easily.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="block-support----wood-and-stone-blocks" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Block support -- wood and stone blocks</h2>
<p>For now you should also remember that wooden blocks (normal wood blocks, platforms, doors) require less support than stone blocks. For example, if you tried to build a bridge, a stone bridge from top of your tower would only be 5 blocks long, while a wooden one would be able to be 25 blocks long.</p>
<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/blocksupport.webm" controls loop="loop" preload>
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>This can often cause confusing situations when you can't place blocks somewhere -- there's not enough support. For example, if you replaced first half of a wooden bridge with stone, you wouldn't be able to build past the 5 blocks.</p>

<div id="block-repairing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Block repairing</h2>
<p>When blocks such as stone blocks, wooden blocks or backwalls get damaged, you can repair them by picking that block from the menu and then building over them. Same amount of materials will be used as if you would be placing a new block (so if you're constantly repairing blocks that are being damaged by enemy builders, you should wait a bit for them to get damaged until they're almost destroyed to buy more time). However, you can't do the same for blocks like doors, platforms or team bridges -- whenever they're being damaged, they need to be fully destroyed before you can build them again in their place.</p>

<div id="common-mistakes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Common mistakes</h2>
<p>There are lots of mistakes that can be made by beginner builders or just less advanced players. Here are some of the most common ones.</p>
<div id="leaving-shops-in-the-open" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.1</span> Leaving shops in the open</h3>
<p>Sometimes less experienced players build shops in the open. This is dangerous, because if any enemies get into your base (by bomb jumps or by catapult, for example) then they will be able to use them -- change class or buy items (e.g. kegs)</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/shopsopen.png"></p>
<p>If you see a shop (mostly knight and builder shops) like that, you should either destroy it if it's in a bad position or encase it with at least some doors and stone blocks. However, if they shop is close to the flag, they're an even bigger danger so you should just destroy them.</p>
</div>
<div id="overusing-stone-doors" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.2</span> Overusing stone doors</h3>
<p>Some players think that wooden doors are too weak and overuse stone doors, like in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/stonedoor1.png"></p>
<p>This is pointless and a total waste of mats. Destroying stone doors by builders takes only slightly longer than wooden doors. The stone should be rather used on additional layers to the tower rather than stone doors. There are 12 stone doors on this screenshot, which is 600 stone. Instead of building stone doors, you should rather make additional stone block layers to your tower.</p>
<p>This is how much you could expand your base by with 600 stone and a bit of wood:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/stonedoor2.png"></p>
</div>
<div id="overusing-wood-not-placing-stone-backwall" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.3</span> Overusing wood, not placing stone backwall</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, if you overuse wood, structures are way too easy to burn. If you're putting lots of doors, put stone backwall behind all of them, same with shops. If you need to make some wooden defences due to lack of stone, you should still try to mix in at least some stone between wooden parts so that everything doesn't burn at once.</p>
<p>Again, comparison of using a fire arrow against structures with wooden backwall vs stone backwall:</p>

</div>
<div id="awkward-top-doors" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.4</span> Awkward top doors</h3>
<p>Sometimes there are doors like this:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/awkwarddoor.png"></p>
<p>It's harder to go through doors like that because you need to jump up and fit properly. This is much easier when doors are to the side, like in the gif below -- in this case you can wallclimb by hugging the wall and it's much easier.</p>
<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/climb.webm" controls loop="loop" preload>
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another solution to make it a bit easier to use such doors would be to place a ladder.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/awkwarddoor2.png"></p>
</div>
<div id="awkward-movement-in-general" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.5</span> Awkward movement in general</h3>
<p>It's important for your knights to be able to move fast in case of incoming enemies, and sometimes odd block placement can cause slower movement around the base. One example is doors not being on floor level when there's no reason to not put them like that:</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/darenokoto.png"></p>
<p>Another example is not having the tunnel in the tower be next to outside doors -- this causes knights to waste time to go to other doors, like this</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/worldogd.png"></p>
</div>
<div id="not-enough-doors" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.6</span> Not enough doors</h3>
<p>Slightly related to above, not placing enough doors (or in some cases, none at all...). There should be lots of doors on each section of of the tower so that enemy builders getting up the tower don't block them all easily. There should be enough doors near the shops too, for similar reasons.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/notdoors.png"></p>
</div>
<div id="certain-shops-at-the-bottom-of-the-tower" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.7</span> Certain shops at the bottom of the tower</h3>
<p>The bottom of the tower is more easily accessed by enemies than the upper parts (for example, if one of your teammates accidentally lets in an enemy knight). You shouldn't place shops like knight shops there (the enemies could buy some kegs after getting there for example).</p>
<p><img src="imgs/01-basic/shopatbottom.png"></p>
<p>You also shouldn't place knight shops near the flag room for similar reasons.</p>
</div>
<div id="putting-a-saw-in-the-flag-room" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.8</span> Putting a saw in the flag room</h3>
<p>There's barely any reason to do this; it's better to have a top entrance so that you can protect the flag if there's enemies above rather than a saw. The saw can be easily avoided by placing ladders and often someone in your team will just accidentally kill themselves, disabling the saw (and also taking away coins from you -- you lose coins when teamkilling somebody).</p>

<div id="progressing-to-victory" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Progressing to victory</h2>
<p>While this chapter was mostly very basic stuff, in the next chapters we'll talk about everything you can do as a builder to help your team get closer to victory, as well as explain some stuff about combat as a builder.</p>
<p>First of all, not every good builder plays the same. There are pretty much three builder playstyles, and which one you will use depends on what is the most fun to you (or if you just want to win -- which one would be the best for your team depending on the situation)</p>
<p><strong>Defensive playstyle</strong> is when you mostly stay in your base and defend your team's base from any enemies, constantly making improvements, mining resources, keeping your team's quarry running, repairing structures and protecting the tower. Some people in-game may find having a builder focusing on stuff like that to be pointless (you don't really help your team to capture the flag, after all), but such a builder is still very useful (especially if the tide turns and your team has to be on the defense) and easy to play for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Progressive/supportive playstyle</strong> is when you focus on winning the game by doing long-term actions that help your team progress. This usually means ensuring you have a decent mid base with a tunnel, buying siege and gradually destroying the enemy tower, or saving up coins over a period of time so you could use them all at once (at explosives, for example). Also includes ratting/tunneling. It's the playstyle which is most likely to lead your team to victory.</p>
<p><strong>Offensive playstyle</strong> is when you prefer to rely on opportunities and basically keep pushing the enemy team, trying to get into the tower or the flag room by drilling or going up the enemy tower. This is heavily dependant on how your knights do -- so you often start pushing with them as soon as they kill a few enemies. Having good situational awareness and knowing how your team is doing, as well as what are the enemies' weaknesses is required. Besides that it's also the most combat-heavy playstyle, and for being the most effective at it you need to be familiar with blockspamming, using drills (the most powerful tool we have), dropping and mobility in general, as well as good reflexes.</p>
