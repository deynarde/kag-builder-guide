[["index.html", "Builder Guide The tactical class of KAG Introduction", " Builder Guide The tactical class of KAG by Bunnie 14/11/2020 Introduction Builder is probably the most advanced class to play in KAG. It's different from the other classes -- from a certain point of view, a Builder can do the most for their team out of all classes. It's mostly a tactical class, although having good reflexes will sometimes help you too; however, not as much muscle memory is needed as for the Knight class. Although this guide is for everyone -- from newbies to players with some experience already -- it'd be good if you already completed the in-game Basics and Capture The Flag tutorials and knew the obvious stuff such as the controls and basic mechanics: mining, building, wallclimbing, changing class, picking up items etc. The guide has a few chapters, which you can see and browse on the left part of the website. For a tutorial on playing as archer see: Archer Guide. For a tutorial on playing as knight see: Knight Guide. If you have any questions about the builder class, you can contact me at the [KAG Discord] (https://discord.gg/kag) - my tag is bunnie#8553. Big thanks to all members of the HOMEK clan which I am the leader of -- especially deynarde for setting this website up, as well as all the people regularly playing Captains which helped me learn Builder.

Although a good team in Capture The Flag (CTF) should be mostly composed of knights, it's the builders who lead the team to victory. Out of 12 people in a full team, at least 3-4 should be builders. As a builder in CTF, your role is to make defences for your flags and base, build shops for your teammates, as well as set up siege and help your team advance and destroy the opposing team's structures, and finally -- capture the enemy flag. You have plenty of tools for that, and winning the game by leading your team is basically your main focus as a builder. In this chapter we're going to explain all the structures you can place and items you can use as a builder, as well as talk a bit about building a good base and a tower. We'll also highlight some common mistakes that inexperienced builders can make. 1.2 Getting materials It is mentioned in the in-game tutorial, but we'll mention it again. You can mine any blocks by holding the right mouse button. There are 2 natural blocks that don't give any materials -- bedrock and dirt. Bedrock can't be destroyed at all. Dirt can be dug, but doesn't give any materials. You can have up to 500 stone, 500 wood or 100 gold in one slot in your inventory (press F). You can take materials out of your inventory by clicking on them with your inventory open (or closing the inventory while your cursor is on one of the slots). Wood and stone are taken out in stacks or 250 (or less if you have less than 250- the first part you take out is the full stack) -- so to throw out 500 wood, you'll need to throw 250 wood two times. Gold is taken out in stacks of 50. Materials such as stone and wood decay when outside of somebody's inventory or outside of a storage (just laying on the ground) after a few minutes. Gold does not. 1.2.1 Stone Stone ore gives 4 stone per hit. Normal stone ores can be hit up to 6 times, so 24 stone per stone ore. Thick stone ore gives 6 stone per hit for 6 hits, then 4 stone per hit for remaining 5 hits. Gives a total of 56 stone after 11 hits. 1.2.2 Gold Gold ore gives 4 gold per hit, can be hit up to 5 times -- 20 gold per gold ore. Keep in mind that you can actually see gold ore on the map -- press M and look for orange spots, like in the images below. 1.2.3 Wood Trees need between 10 and 12 hits to fall down and drop logs. Trees have varying height, even when they reach their maximum height, but pine trees of maximum height drop 6 or 7 logs, while the smaller, bushy trees drop 3, 4 or 5 logs. One log gives 10 wood per hit, 5 hits per log -- so up to 50 wood per a log. Trees of course can regrow after being chopped down. Although it also varies, it takes between 30 and 100 seconds, with bushy trees regrowing faster than pine trees. 1.2.4 Resupplies This is an important mechanic that a lot of people overlook. During the building time (the first 180 seconds of a standard CTF match), you can get free materials from the tent or a builder shop every 40 seconds. You get 300 wood and 100 stone. In game time, you get 100 wood and 30 stone every 20 seconds. Keep in mind that the materials stack, so if you were next to the tent for 60 seconds straight, you'd get 300 wood and 90 stone in game time. If you're staying in your base, it's good to constantly get resupplies -- it may not seem like much, but it adds up and you can eventually decently expand your base. 1.3 Your building menu In this section we'll shortly describe each of the blocks in the builder menu, which you can access by pressing F. A builder's building menu consists of 11 blocks/structures, as you can see in the image below: Blocks can cost either wood or stone. Placing blocks gives you coins - depending on what you're placing and if you're placing it during build time (the first 180 seconds where teams build their bases) or game time. 1.3.1 Stone block Costs 10 stone. Gives 4 coins when placed in game time, 1 coin in build time. Can be destroyed by builders (7 hits), bombs (1 bomb if the bomb is next to the block) bomb arrows, kegs, mines. Gives 1 stone per hit (7 stone total). The most basic block. The majority of your defences should consist of this block. 1.3.2 Stone backwall Costs 2 stone. Doesn't give coins. Can be destroyed by builders (5 hits), explosives. Doesn't give stone on hit. You should support your stone block walls with stone backwalls. 1.3.3 Stone door Costs 50 stone. Gives 4 coins when placed in game time, 1 coin in build time. Can be destroyed by builders (5 hits), explosives (5 bombs per 1 stone door!). Gives 5 stone per hit (25 stone total). Strong block, especially against enemy knights. However, quite expensive, so don't overuse them. Doors can only be opened by teammates. Doors (both stone and wooden ones) should be placed next to a solid block, or else they will fall off after some time. 1.3.4 Wood block Costs 10 wood. Gives 1 coin when placed in game time, 0 coins in build time. Can be destroyed by builders (5 hits), explosives. Flammable -- can be put on fire by fire arrows and spread fire to nearby wooden structures. Destroyable by knights (5 slashes) Gives 1 wood per hit (5 wood total). You shouldn't overuse them -- burning wooden structures is extremely easy. However it's decent for some basic defences when you don't have stone. 1.3.5 Wood backwall Costs 2 wood. Doesn't give coins. Can be destroyed by builders (2 hits), explosives. Flammable. Doesn't give wood on hit. 1.3.6 Wood door Costs 30 wood. Gives 1 coin when placed in game time, 0 coins in build time. Can be destroyed by builders (4 hits), explosives. Flammable. Destroyable by knights (14 slashes) Gives 5 wood on hit (20 wood total). Doors can only be opened by teammates. Doors should be placed next to a solid block, or else they will fall off after some time. 1.3.7 Trapblock Costs 30 wood Gives 1 coin when placed in game time, 0 coins in build time. Can be destroyed by builders (5 hits), explosives Gives 2 wood per hit (10 wood total). Enemies fall through when trying to walk on it. Players of same colour as team bridge are able to go down team bridges by pressing S. Keep in mind that this is a new addition which replaces the old stone trapblock, which was completely unpassable by teammates. Some gifs in the guide may still have gifs with it. It looked like this: 1.3.8 Ladder Costs 10 wood. Doesn't give coins. Can be destroyed by builders (2 hits), explosives Destroyable by knights (2 slashes) Gives 3 wood per hit (6 wood total). Can be climbed by holding W while on them Ladders are 3x1. You can rotate them by pressing Space after selecting one. Ladders can overlap. The center of a ladder is the team-coloured part. You don't have to place the centres next to each other -- if you want to build a few ladders on top of each other, there can be a 1 block gap between the centres. This saves some wood. 1.3.9 Platform Costs 15 wood. Gives 1 coin when placed in game time, 0 coins in build time. Can be destroyed by builders (5 hits), explosives. Flammable. Destroyable by knights (10 slashes) Gives 2 wood on hit (10 wood total). You can't go through them if they're facing against you. You can rotate them with space if you want different directions. Also places a wooden backwall behind when you build one. Even though enemies can't go through their solid side, knights can still attack you through it with slashes -- make sure to not get too close. 1.3.10 Workshop Costs 150 wood. Gives 10 coins when placed in game time, 3 coins in build time. Can be destroyed by builders (4 hits), explosives. Flammable. Destroyable by knights (8 slashes) Doesn't give wood on hit. 3 blocks wide and 5 blocks tall. Can be converted to one of the 9 CTF shops after being built (requires additional materials). We'll talk more about them in the next section. Shops that cost gold drop gold when destroyed. Places some wooden backwall behind when placed. 1.3.11 Spikes Costs 30 stone. Gives 4 coins when placed in game time, 1 coin in build time. Can be destroyed by builders (2 hits), explosives. Doesn't give stone on hit. Can be placed on any solid blocks. Does damage to all players -- including teammates -- when they jump on one, as well as stunning them for a short while. If placed on a stone block, the spike retracts and only activates when there's an enemy near it (it's not instant, though, which lets enemies just walk over before they get damaged) If not placed on a solid block (for example, on backwall or next to a door or platform), the spike falls and damages the players it falls on. The spike deals damage depending on how much distance it fell from. For 1 heart of damage you can just place a spike right above somebody (0 tiles of distance), for 2 hearts -- 2 tiles, 3 hearts -- at least 4 tiles and for 4 hearts you need at least 7 tiles. 1.4 Workshops, items, siege After you place a workshop (150 wood), you can convert it to one of the 9 different shops. Most of them cost additional wood (converting an empty workshop to a new shop costs wood), but some cost stone and gold as well. In this section we'll talk about all the different shops and builder-related items and vehicles you can buy in them. All enemies are also able to use your shops -- place them carefully. 1.4.1 Builder shop Costs 50 wood. One of the three class shops -- if you aren't the class of the shop (if you aren't a builder in this case), you have the option to change to builder on it. The second option (for all classes) is to open the shop. Now, let's talk about the items you can buy: 1.4.1.1 Lantern Costs 10 wood. Generates light. 1x1 size in inventory. Can be turned on and off with Space button. Lanterns don't work in water (they turn off by themselves), unless they're in your inventory. If you have several lanterns in inventory, there's slightly more light, but not much. 1.4.1.2 Bucket (no water) Costs 10 wood. 1x1 size in inventory. Fills with water if you put it in water. 1.4.1.3 Bucket with water Costs 10 wood and 10 coins 1x1 size in inventory. You can press left mouse button while you have one in your hand to splash water. The water can extinguish fires, as well as extinguish a lit keg (which is unique for the water bucket -- water bombs or water arrows can't do that). Water buckets extinguish through walls as well. You can make up to 3 water splashes before the bucket becomes empty and requires refilling. When you use a water bucket on someone with a lit keg, besides extinguishing the fuse, they also drop the keg if they were holding it, which gives you some time to pick it up. Can also cool a heated drill 1.4.1.4 Sponge Costs 15 coins. 1x1 size in inventory. You can use it to remove water blocks, like in gif below. If you have one in inventory and you get hit by a water bomb or a water arrow, the sponge will absorb the stun. This can happen up to 2 times before the sponge gets destroyed. 1.4.1.5 Boulder Costs 35 stone. Around 2x2 size (2 blocks wide and tall) Doesn't fit in inventory (3x3 size, so it fits in storage). You can throw it at enemies to damage them. The damage depends on the velocity of the boulder; for the most damage, you should throw the boulder from the top of your tower. If you put a boulder in a catapult and then launch it, it has a new functionality -- it also goes through blocks. Some believe this is a bug, but it works like in the GIF below. This is especially good against thick towers -- it destroys a lot of backwalls and goes through all of the blocks, making a lot of damage. 1.4.1.6 Trampoline Costs 150 wood. 3 blocks wide, 1 block tall. Doesn't fit in inventory. Lets players bounce of it. When held in your hand, you can rotate it to 3 directions so that it points up or diagonally. Put on top of your tower for quicker travel for your knights. 1.4.1.7 Drill Costs 100 stone and 25 coins. 1x1 size in inventory. Builders (but not knights and archers) can use a drill by holding left mouse button while you have one in your hand. It destroys blocks much more quicker than if you were destroying them using pickaxe. The drill destroys 2 blocks in front of it. Drills are aimed in the direction of your cursor. The more blocks you destroy, the hotter the drill gets -- eventually it can overheat and deal you 0.25heart of damage and drop to the ground while releasing steam. If that happens, don't instantly try to pick it back up -- it will keep damaging you and dropping to the ground. You have to wait a few seconds. Heated drills emit light, so you can sometimes spot tunneling rats with drills. Drills also deal 1 heart of damage to enemies per hit. When they're 50% heated (at least half of the bar), they deal 1.5 heart of damage. Drills deal half of the damage when shielded -- so 0.5 heart or 0.75 heart of damage to shielding knights. They obviously also deal damage faster than pickaxe. As mentioned earlier, drills can be cooled down by using any kind of water on it (water bomb, water arrow or water bucket). They also cool down naturally over time (also while they're in your inventory). You can speed up the cooling down slightly if you move around with your drill in hand. There's also a bar that shows you how heated a drill is. Drills overheat quicker on natural blocks (stone ore, dirt) than on man-made blocks (stone blocks, wooden blocks). They also overheat even quicker (the fastest) on blocks such as doors, platforms or shops, as well as on trees. Drills can be used to damage enemies in a situation like in the gif below (pay attention to what is a door and what is a normal block), while the knights can't damage you. This is a bit more advanced and is related to doors having an odd functionality -- we'll tell you more about it in the 4th chapter in the combat-related section. Although drills cool down in water, drilling in water (both enemies and blocks) is much slower. 1.4.1.8 Saw Costs 150 wood and 100 stone. 3 blocks wide, 2 blocks tall. Doesn't fit in inventory. You can press E on the saw to turn it off and on. Players (both enemies and teammates) instantly die if they fall into a saw. If a teammate falls into a team's saw, the saw turns off after killing them. If a corpse of a player of the same team as the saw falls into it, the saw also turns off. Saws change team depending on who last held the saw. You can't pick up enemy saws from above or from their side. You need to be at a lower level than them. Another functionality of saws is that they convert logs into wood quickly. More about this will be mentioned next chapter (building a &quot;tree farm&quot;). Items like crates also get destroyed when thrown into a saw (also if thrown at the side or bottom of the saw). Lit bombs and kegs explode instantly when thrown into a saw (also if thrown at the side or bottom of the saw). 1.4.1.9 Crate Costs either 150 wood or 20 coins. 3 blocks wide, 2 blocks tall. Doesn't fit in inventory. A crate has a 3x3 inventory -- you can put items in it. The crate should be on the ground, while you should hold the item you want to put in a crate in your inventory then press E on it. If you hold a crate and walk over items such as materials or unlit bombs laying on the ground, the crate will pick them up. They can be removed out of the crate manually or by pressing Space while having it in your hand. Players can also get into crates -- you need to pick a crate up (so that it's in your hand), and then press E on it. Other players can also pick up the crate. This is a good way for builders to be &quot;delivered&quot; to enemy territory safely by the knights in your team. You can get out of a crate by pressing E again. You can remove enemies from enemy crates by pressing E on it, however, it will stun you for a short time. That's all of the items in the builder shop. 1.4.2 Quarters Costs 50 wood. The shop has 2 features -- if you aren't at full health, you can select the sleep button and regain 0.25 heart per second. The other button is opening the shop menu, which contains 4 options -- a beer, a meal, an egg and a burger. 1.4.2.1 Beer Costs 5 coins. Gives you 1 heart of health -- it's worth buying only if you need 1 heart to full health. 1.4.2.2 Meal Costs 10 coins. Refills your health to full. 1.4.2.3 Egg Costs 30 coins. 1x1 inventory size. If you walk over an egg while damaged, you will eat the egg. However, it's not just a food item -- after some time a chicken hatches out of the egg. If you hold a chicken in your hand, you fall slower. If there are 2 or more chickens, they also breed and produce more eggs. Chickens also have a 1x1 inventory size. Chickens are pretty much only used if you want to travel more distance when being launched out of a catapult. 1.4.2.4 Burger Costs 20 coins. 1x1 inventory size. It's an item which you can carry around. It refills your health to full. You can also give burgers to others. If you have a burger in your inventory (this also applies if you have a heart or any other food item in your inventory), and you don't have full health, you can press V to quickly heal. When two builders have a 1v1 pickaxe fight, the deciding factor is usually if someone has a heart or a burger. If you have some free space in inventory you could carry a burger for such situations. It's also useful for when you get slightly damaged by a bomb. 1.4.3 Knight shop Costs 50 wood, another class shop -- so you have the option to swap class to Knight or open the shop menu. Since this is a builder guide, we're focusing only on the items which you can use, which in this case would be the mine. 1.4.3.1 Mine The 3rd item in the knight shop. Costs 60 coins. 1x1 inventory size. When you put one on the ground, it deploys after being still for 1.5 a second. Instantly kills any enemies that walk into it and causes a small explosion (which also instantly kills enemies nearby). Unshieldable by knights. If the person who placed the mine was next to it during the explosion, they also die. You can pick up enemy mines if they haven't deployed yet. The mine changes to your team if you do that. It's a good tactic to put mines in your flag rooms or next to enemy doors. Hardly visible for enemies when put behind a bush. 1.4.4 Archer shop Costs 50 wood, is a class shop. Sells special arrows for archers. 1.4.5 Naval shop Costs 100 wood and 50 gold. Sells boats -- this shop is pretty much useful only on maps with lots of water. All enemy boats can be captured by staying on them for long enough. 1.4.5.1 Dinghy Costs 150 wood. 6 blocks wide, about 1 block tall. Two people can enter a dinghy. Weakest out of all the boats. You can enter a dinghy by pressing S on it. Row the boat by holding A or D. The more people that row the boat, the faster it goes. However they have to row in the same direction -- if they row in the opposite direction, the dinghy won't move. Has a 6x5 storage (press E to open it. As mentioned earlier, in order to put something in a storage, you must have an item in your hand and then press E on the storage button.) 1.4.5.2 Longboat Costs 200 wood and 50 coins. Comes in a crate when bought -- it must be unpacked in water. Has 6 rowing spots (press S to enter one) Fastest out of all the boats -- especially if rowed by 6 people. Has a 12x5 storage. Longboats crush enemies and structures when fast enough. 1.4.5.3 War Boat Costs 250 coins. Comes in a crate when bought -- it must be unpacked in water. Slower than a longboat, but also the hardest to destroy. Has 6 rowing spots. Has one mounted bow on top which lets you shoot arrows (press S to get in). If it runs out of arrows, press E with arrows in your hand to refill it. Has a 12x6 storage. You can change class on a war boat by holding E and selecting the &quot;change class&quot; button. War boats are also respawn points (if you die, you can respawn at a war boat). You can't respawn on a war boat if there are enemies on it, though. They also crush enemies and structures when fast enough. 1.4.6 Siege shop Costs 100 wood and 50 gold. Lets you buy siege vehicles -- catapults and ballistas. They're quite useful, and gold is rare on some of the maps, so make sure you place a siege shop in a secure place. 1.4.6.1 Catapult Costs 80 coins. Comes in a crate when bought -- it must be unpacked in a spot with enough place. It has 3 spots right after unpacking: the driving spot, the firing spot, and the spot in the bowl. You enter the spots by clicking S on them, obviously. For the upper spot in the bowl, you have to jump up first and then press S. You can remove the wheels by pressing E and clicking the remove wheels button. You should do this pretty much every time if you plan the catapult to be a stationary one on top of your tower. This removes the driver spot and can't be undone. Catapults can launch items, as well as players. When you enter the firing spot, you can launch by holding your left mouse button. If you want to put an item in a catapult, you must first have the item in your hand, hold E and then press the &quot;load item&quot; button next to the bowl. Catapults can also fire rocks. Each catapult after unpacking has 100 stone. One rock launch costs 10 stone. They do some slight damage to structures, especially backwall, as well as do lots of damage to enemies. You can refill catapults with stone by holding E and clicking the &quot;Load stone&quot; button if you have stone in your inventory. Keep in mind that enemy archers can destroy your catapult with only a single bomb arrow. Also, if you haven't removed the wheels, archers can shoot the catapult and make it drive away. This can cause the catapult to fall off sometimes, which is why removing wheels is recommended. 1.4.6.2 Ballista Costs 200 coins. Comes in a crate when bought -- it must be unpacked in a spot with enough place. Has a driving spot and a firing spot. You can remove the wheels (same as in catapult). Press E and select the &quot;immobilise&quot; option. A ballista spawns with 12 bolts. More can be bought in the siege shop. If you haven't upgraded the bolts in the vehicle shop (last option), the firing spot can shoot normal bolts that instakill enemies if they hit them. If the bolts are upgraded, the ballista fires explosive bolts instead that damage structures too. However, it consumes 2 bolts instead of one (so if a ballista has 12 bolts, it actually only will shoot 6 explosive bolts). Explosive bolts instantly kill enemies as well. You can also change classes on ballistas (including enemy ones) -- hold E and select the &quot;change class&quot; option. They also work as a respawn point, similar to war boats. If you die and your team has a ballista, you can select it to respawn on it. You can't respawn on a ballista if it's being captured by the enemies (capturing any vehicle in KAG means standing near it for some amount of time). Enemy archers can destroy your ballista with two bomb arrows. Similar to catapults -- enemy archers can shoot arrows at a ballista with wheels and make it drive away. Removing wheels is recommended. If a ballista is flipped over due to a collapse or being driven away, it will be damaged and destroy itself after a few seconds. To prevent that, as soon as it flips over you should spam the &quot;Flip vehicle&quot; button that appears when you hold E, which should flip it back. 1.4.6.3 Ballista bolts Costs 100 coins. One stack of 12 ballista bolts. Put new ballista bolts in a ballista by holding them in your hand, holding E on a ballista and selecting the &quot;load ballista bolts&quot; option. 1.4.6.4 Bomb bolt upgrade Costs 100 gold. When bought, it applies to any future ballistas bought by your team in the match, even if it's a different siege shop. Future ballistas will now fire explosive bolts, as mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that this upgrade does not apply to ballistas you have unpacked before getting the upgrade. 1.4.7 Storage Costs 50 stone and 50 wood. Has a 4x2 storage which lets a team store items. Holding E and clicking the &quot;Store&quot; button will put all the items in your inventory into the storage. If you want to put a single item into the storage, you must first hold it in your hand, then select the other &quot;Storage&quot; button. Harder to destroy than other shops (12 pickaxe hits needed to destroy one; wooden shops require 4 hits). Good for storing gold, as well as excess wood and stone that you don't currently need. 1.4.8 Tunnel Costs 50 gold, 100 stone and 50 wood. If you have 2 or more tunnels, you can quickly travel between them. If you have only 2 tunnels, just pressing E on the tunnel will let you travel to the other one. If you have 3 or more tunnels, you will also have to select what tunnel you want to go to. You are stunned for a second after using a tunnel. Tunnel is even more durable than a storage (16 pickaxe hit needed to destroy one) Tunnels usually should connect the most important parts of the map for your team: there should be one next to the tent, one in the tower, one or more in middle of the map (if you have control of it). 1.4.9 Quarry Costs 150 stone and 100 gold. There's a limit of only 1 per team. You can put wood into a quarry in order to convert it to stone. If you have wood, just hold E and press the &quot;add fuel&quot; button. Can hold up to 500 wood. Converts 100 wood to 75 stone every 30 seconds. The stone falls to the ground on the 2nd tile of the shop from the left. Since it falls like that, many people put quarries above a storage with a 1 tile gap so that the stone goes into the storage like in the gif below. 1.5 Building a base The build time is the first 180 seconds of the match with an uncrossable red zone in the middle. The point is to obviously build a decent base before you start fighting with the opposing teams. The more builders in a team know how to make good defences, the more likely it is that you're going to win (or at least lose slower). Of course, if you want to, you can keep building the base after the build time ends. Often there's still lots of materials left, so you can keep improving the base. 1.5.1 A front tower Besides having your flags be well protected, having a decent tower is also very important. A good way to start building a front tower in 40 seconds is to build some ladders up, add some stone backwall and then build a builder shop like in the image below. Make sure to not place more than 10 ladders so that you have enough materials for a builder shop. If you decide to focus on the tower for the entirety of the build time, you're most likely going to work around here. As mentioned earlier, the builder shop lets you get resupplies -- you should walk to one every 40 seconds (on around 140 seconds left, 100, 60 and 20) to get free 100 stone and 300 wood. Usually you end up using all the materials you have before the next resupply, so if that happens you should go dig some stone and return for the next batch of resupplies. Keep in mind you can't make everything by yourself in an actual CTF match -- this is a team game after all, so other players should help you and also build a bit. You should pretty much build what is missing or improve the parts that could be better. This part will just tell you how a good tower should look like. After building a builder shop, it's good to make the front wall. Usually making a 3 block thick wall is enough. We start with placing 3 layers of doors at the bottom -- 5 wooden doors and 1 stone door. We don't want to place too many stone doors so that we have enough stone for the actual wall itself. After placing the doors we place stone walls. Keep in mind you can actually place blocks in the red zone! Usually we build it like this: First, the outer layer made out of stone only: After that, the middle layer is going to be wood: Replace every 4th or 5th wooden block with stone -- so that if the outer layer gets broken, the archers can't burn the entire middle layer at once: And then the inner layer, stone only: That's a solid front wall already. If you have some stone left, it'd be good to add some more backwalls so that the tower isn't too easy to collapse. Okay, so we have a builder shop and a basic front wall. However, a good tower obviously has more. It'd be good to have the most basic shops in a tower + a tunnel. It's good to have a tunnel above the builder shop, then a knight shop (close to the tunnel, because majority of your team should be knights) then an archer shop (on top, because that's where defensive archers can shoot from). A food shop could be useful as well. Somewhat like this: The empty shop is going to be a tunnel later -- we need to find some gold first. It's good to have lots, lots of doors -- in case the enemies get into your tower, the enemy builders will usually not be able to block all the doors and your knights will be able to defeat them by using doors to their advantage. So it can look somewhat like this, with every shop having 6 sets of doors: Next, you want to replace majority of the wooden backwalls from the shops and doors with stone backwalls. Fire spreads much slower and much less with stone backwalls than if there were wooden backwalls. Here's a comparison of using a fire arrow against a part of a tower, but one part has stone backwalls for doors and shops while one has wooden: Obviously, you don't want the front wall to be thinner above. We build additional 3 layers of wooden doors next to every shop (again, the more doors there are -- the harder for enemy builders to block them all) and add stone. The bottom could use some work too. Add some more doors and stone blocks, so that if the enemies get through the first set of doors they don't have too much space to fight, and so that the tower is harder to collapse. Sometimes you can choose to add a bit of platforms somewhere too, for example on the top, so that defensive archers can be protected from enemy arrows. Stone backwall is advised again. Adding a trampoline after the game starts (the red zone bounces it back) is also good. If you have wood left, you can place doors pretty much everywhere. The more doors the better. Here's a 3 min video example of building a tower on public CTF along with some other people: 1.5.2 Flag rooms Flag rooms should have at least 2 entrances, preferably 3, so that if one gets blocked you can still use the other ones -- one from the top and two from the sides, like this: Keep in mind that stone doors like that are enough; wooden doors are pretty powerful. You don't need to overuse stone doors. The doors from the tent's side should be on floor level so that knights can quickly get there. However, the one on the right side -- from the enemy's side -- shouldn't be placed like that; worse players can sometimes open the entrance accidentally and die, letting enemies get into the flag room. Making the entrance not on floor level partially prevents this. Of course, the thicker a flag room is, the better -- if you have lots of materials, you can make it as thick as you want. If you lose the flags you lose the game, after all. However, if you're making it thicker, it's good to have some additional doors for easier movement. It's also good to put a mine in each flag room (or even 2!). If any enemies eventually come to the flag, they will have to destroy the mine first and often they will just walk into it accidentally. 1.5.3 Tunnels As I mentioned earlier, there should be a tunnel in your tower for quick travel. The first tunnel should be next to your tent (or at least close to it). The tunnel near your tent should always have a sawtrap. A sawtrap like this -- team bridges, the tunnel on it and the saw under the team bridges. Here's how to build one: 1.5.4 Tree farm A tree farm is very useful to all the builders in your team -- it lets you get lots of wood easily, which also lets you get stone from quarries. The idea is to place trees next to each other with 1 tile gaps, and have them be seperated like this: After that, you get a saw and put it like this. Destroying the trees will now make all of the logs fall downwards instead of the tree falling to the side. The logs, when destroyed by the saw, are converted to wood. This is much quicker than if you were chopping them manually. If you have a bigger tree farm, you don't have to get another saw -- you can just move the saw around. Also, if you have a saw, it's actually faster to chop down trees as a knight than as a builder -- a slash can damage 2 trees at once. So if the tree farm is near the tent you could quickly swap to knight to do that. Trees can grow on bedrock, dirt and stone, but they can't grow on man-made blocks like stone blocks or wood blocks. Also, sometimes it may bug out and the logs may not fall through and instead get stuck on the top. I believe this doesn't happen as often if there's more blocks vertically seperating the trees, like in the image below. If for some reason the logs do not fall into the saw (or it was accidentally turned off), you can just throw the saw at the logs, like in the gif below. 1.5.5 Shops It's good to have some shops outside of the tower too, in case the ones in the tower get destroyed. Usually you should have some near the tent. Make sure that you replace some of the wooden backwalls with stone backwalls so that it's not as easy to burn. Also, make sure they have good protection (doors) so that the enemies can't get in too easily. 1.6 Block support -- wood and stone blocks For now you should also remember that wooden blocks (normal wood blocks, platforms, doors) require less support than stone blocks. For example, if you tried to build a bridge, a stone bridge from top of your tower would only be 5 blocks long, while a wooden one would be able to be 25 blocks long. This can often cause confusing situations when you can't place blocks somewhere -- there's not enough support. For example, if you replaced first half of a wooden bridge with stone, you wouldn't be able to build past the 5 blocks. 1.7 Block repairing When blocks such as stone blocks, wooden blocks or backwalls get damaged, you can repair them by picking that block from the menu and then building over them. Same amount of materials will be used as if you would be placing a new block (so if you're constantly repairing blocks that are being damaged by enemy builders, you should wait a bit for them to get damaged until they're almost destroyed to buy more time). However, you can't do the same for blocks like doors, platforms or team bridges -- whenever they're being damaged, they need to be fully destroyed before you can build them again in their place. 1.8 Common mistakes There are lots of mistakes that can be made by beginner builders or just less advanced players. Here are some of the most common ones. 1.8.1 Leaving shops in the open Sometimes less experienced players build shops in the open. This is dangerous, because if any enemies get into your base (by bomb jumps or by catapult, for example) then they will be able to use them -- change class or buy items (e.g. kegs) If you see a shop (mostly knight and builder shops) like that, you should either destroy it if it's in a bad position or encase it with at least some doors and stone blocks. However, if they shop is close to the flag, they're an even bigger danger so you should just destroy them. 1.8.2 Overusing stone doors Some players think that wooden doors are too weak and overuse stone doors, like in the image below. This is pointless and a total waste of mats. Destroying stone doors by builders takes only slightly longer than wooden doors. The stone should be rather used on additional layers to the tower rather than stone doors. There are 12 stone doors on this screenshot, which is 600 stone. Instead of building stone doors, you should rather make additional stone block layers to your tower. This is how much you could expand your base by with 600 stone and a bit of wood: 1.8.3 Overusing wood, not placing stone backwall As mentioned earlier, if you overuse wood, structures are way too easy to burn. If you're putting lots of doors, put stone backwall behind all of them, same with shops. If you need to make some wooden defences due to lack of stone, you should still try to mix in at least some stone between wooden parts so that everything doesn't burn at once. Again, comparison of using a fire arrow against structures with wooden backwall vs stone backwall: 1.8.4 Awkward top doors Sometimes there are doors like this: It's harder to go through doors like that because you need to jump up and fit properly. This is much easier when doors are to the side, like in the gif below -- in this case you can wallclimb by hugging the wall and it's much easier. Another solution to make it a bit easier to use such doors would be to place a ladder. 1.8.5 Awkward movement in general It's important for your knights to be able to move fast in case of incoming enemies, and sometimes odd block placement can cause slower movement around the base. One example is doors not being on floor level when there's no reason to not put them like that: Another example is not having the tunnel in the tower be next to outside doors -- this causes knights to waste time to go to other doors, like this 1.8.6 Not enough doors Slightly related to above, not placing enough doors (or in some cases, none at all...). There should be lots of doors on each section of of the tower so that enemy builders getting up the tower don't block them all easily. There should be enough doors near the shops too, for similar reasons. 1.8.7 Certain shops at the bottom of the tower The bottom of the tower is more easily accessed by enemies than the upper parts (for example, if one of your teammates accidentally lets in an enemy knight). You shouldn't place shops like knight shops there (the enemies could buy some kegs after getting there for example). You also shouldn't place knight shops near the flag room for similar reasons. 1.8.8 Putting a saw in the flag room There's barely any reason to do this; it's better to have a top entrance so that you can protect the flag if there's enemies above rather than a saw. The saw can be easily avoided by placing ladders and often someone in your team will just accidentally kill themselves, disabling the saw (and also taking away coins from you -- you lose coins when teamkilling somebody). 1.9 Progressing to victory While this chapter was mostly very basic stuff, in the next chapters we'll talk about everything you can do as a builder to help your team get closer to victory, as well as explain some stuff about combat as a builder. First of all, not every good builder plays the same. There are pretty much three builder playstyles, and which one you will use depends on what is the most fun to you (or if you just want to win -- which one would be the best for your team depending on the situation) Defensive playstyle is when you mostly stay in your base and defend your team's base from any enemies, constantly making improvements, mining resources, keeping your team's quarry running, repairing structures and protecting the tower. Some people in-game may find having a builder focusing on stuff like that to be pointless (you don't really help your team to capture the flag, after all), but such a builder is still very useful (especially if the tide turns and your team has to be on the defense) and easy to play for beginners. Progressive/supportive playstyle is when you focus on winning the game by doing long-term actions that help your team progress. This usually means ensuring you have a decent mid base with a tunnel, buying siege and gradually destroying the enemy tower, or saving up coins over a period of time so you could use them all at once (at explosives, for example). Also includes ratting/tunneling. It's the playstyle which is most likely to lead your team to victory. Offensive playstyle is when you prefer to rely on opportunities and basically keep pushing the enemy team, trying to get into the tower or the flag room by drilling or going up the enemy tower. This is heavily dependant on how your knights do -- so you often start pushing with them as soon as they kill a few enemies. Having good situational awareness and knowing how your team is doing, as well as what are the enemies' weaknesses is required. Besides that it's also the most combat-heavy playstyle, and for being the most effective at it you need to be familiar with blockspamming, using drills (the most powerful tool we have), dropping and mobility in general, as well as good reflexes.

In this chapter we'll mention some stuff you could do as a defensive builder. 2.2 Resource management As a builder, you always need materials to do something -- even in a progressive or offensive playstyle. Some of your time should be spent on getting such materials. Of course, you want to have a tree farm (preferably with at least 3 trees, but the more the better) with a saw and a quarry -- this will let you both get wood and stone easily. You should always cut down trees when they reach maximum height, and make sure quarries are running -- you should refill them every 2 minutes (100 wood gets converted to 75 stone every 30 seconds; a quarry has a limit of 500 wood). If your tree farm doesn't have enough trees, you should get some trees from the middle of the map -- cut them down and take the seed. Small thing to keep in mind here: you'll usually have problems with picking up and you will pick up logs instead of the seed. Hold C and move your mouse around until it says that you're actually selecting a seed. Second thing to remember about -- a seed changes into a tree after a relatively short time, but it still shows a seed. You can't pick it up, so you need to hit the &quot;seed&quot; a few times again until you can pick it up again. Another thing to keep in mind: trees can't grow next to each other, like in the image below. There needs to be at least 1 block gap between the seeds. The seed in the image will turn into a tree only once the tree next to it gets chopped down. It's good to have a storage under a quarry as mentioned in the previous chapter -- if stone lays on the ground, it can decay after some time. Besides quarries, you should make use of the resupplies in game time. Remember -- every 20 seconds you can get additional 100 wood and 30 stone from a builder shop or a tent just by standing on it. Of course, if you want even more stone, you can just go and mine stone ore. Most of the maps have quite a bit of it, so if you don't see any you could try digging around. 2.3 Base expansion As a defensive builder, what you want to do most of the time is usually expand your base. There are different ways to expand your base. Before starting expansion, make sure that there's a tunnel (the workshop) connecting the tent and the tower. Saves a lot of time for your teammates -- it's a must. The easiest way to base expand is to constantly add layers to your tower (the one you make in build time). There are a few ways to do it as well. First way -- keep adding doors+stone block layers, such as this: However, eventually the wall will become so thick that if one of the doors will be blocked, you will have to backtrack too much to get to the upper doors. To make movement a bit easier it's good to make doors for moving upwards. Generally we can build 3 additional layers + doors upwards + 3 additional layers and so on, like in the image below Of course, you could also do 2 layers instead of 3 or add more doors instead of so many stone blocks if you have wood. You can also expand by just building what I like to call &quot;door lettuce&quot;. This is good especially if you have lots of wood. Basically, you keep building doors with stone blocks connecting each pair. Make sure to add some stone backwall too. This is even harder for enemy builders to block, as well as allowing good movement for your knights. Second way is not directly expanding the tower, but making a wall 10-15 blocks away from the front tower and then connecting it, but without as many layers -- mostly some wood and backwall. This works well on maps that are a bit bigger. After that you can just pretty much make improvements -- make it taller, make the connection stronger, add aditional doors and so on. No matter what way of base expansion you're using, you'll eventually probably want to move the tunnel forward (to save time for your teammates), as well as place additional shops. If you have decided to finish base expansion for now you should add downward facing platforms after the doors -- like this. This makes it harder for enemy builders to climb up your tower. The 1 block gaps are for spike dropping -- spikes can't drop through platforms at all. 2.4 Different functionality of platforms Now, one additional thing that is not really related to base expansion, but to building defences in general -- using additional platforms between stone layers. As mentioned in the first chapter, when making 3-block thick walls you can put wood blocks in between to not use as much stone. However, some people put platforms, and this can be kind of bad if the enemy team has good archers. The good thing about it is that drills overheat quicker on platforms (as well as on doors) than on normal blocks: Keep in mind that when drilling platforms like that, you also drill the blocks behind them at the same time. Although protection from drills is good, the con here is that bomb arrows destroy the middle layer of platforms when they hit the outer stone layer as well. This is the con of using platforms. Doesn't matter which directions they're facing. However, they can absorb all the damage from bomb arrows in certain situations: when they're facing away from the enemy side and they face a block (gif below) a bomb arrow will only damage a single platform and nothing else. Keep in mind that even if it's like in the gif below (additional stone layer), a single bomb arrow still damages the platforms. So, as you can see -- although platforms are good against drills, they're not that good against bomb arrows in most of the situations. However, if you want to stop base expanding, then an outer layer consisting solely of platforms would be a good idea. They're also viable for blocking tunnels -- it's very unlikely for enemy archers to use bomb arrows in tunnels, so you can block tunnels by using platforms between stone layers. You can also use them on skybridges or ledges (when facing downwards), like in the gif below -- any bomb arrows that will hit the platforms from above will only damage a single platform and not do much damage to the ledge. Comparison -- with platforms and without: Keep in mind this only provides protection from bomb arrows, not firearrows. As for fire, you should have a builder shop around if you're using lots of wood so you can buy water buckets to extinguish fire. 2.5 Setting up siege on top of tower It's good to have a ballista and a catapult on top of your tower. As mentioned in previous chapter, you can buy a ballista for 200 coins from the siege shop, and a catapult for 80 coins. Ballistas can shoot explosive bolts (if you bought the upgrade) and let people respawn on it when they die, catapults can launch teammates. First, you want to make a small (or a bit bigger -- depends on how far you want it to be able to shoot) ledge on top of your tower. Put some wooden blocks, and then one or two layers of stone blocks on top of it (wooden blocks provide more support than stone blocks, letting you build further). Make sure to not build it too close to the sky border (if you build it too high, you may not be able to unpack siege or build additional protections for it) Generally, if you plan to shoot bolts from the ballista, or if you're placing a catapult you should build some platforms (and stone backwall!) like in the gif below: This provides good protection against enemy bomb arrows, as well as from enemy knights that may bomb jump to your tower. However, keep in mind that even with stone backwall platforms can still burn, so it's good to have a builder shop or a water bucket around to extinguish fires. If you do not have explosive bolts or the bolts wouldn't do any damage to enemy structures, you want to encase your ballista in some thicker stone block defences, such as in the image below. Also, it's better to just do it on top of your tower instead of on a ledge -- a ledge can be collapsed. People will still be able to respawn and it'll be very hard for enemies to damage a ballista like this. Knights are likely to make use of your catapult -- if you see any knight get into the bowl, you should launch them. This is one of the most useful things a defensive builder can do for their team -- constantly launch knights to the enemy side. Another thing you could do is set up a chicken farm -- make a small room like the image below, and put a few eggs there (buy them from a food shop). Make sure the eggs are in a separate location than a food shop (preferably with only 1 door to them), so that your knights don't kill them acidentally. Chickens will eventually hatch from the eggs, and then breed and produce even more eggs. Knights (as well as offensive builders) will be able to fly even further from the catapult if they will hold chickens. 2.6 Spike dropping Although spikes are fairly expensive (30 stone) they're a good tool to protect your base from incoming enemies. The idea is to drop a spike if any enemies (especially a builder) get near your tower. Remember that spikes can be dropped if they're placed on a backwall or next to doors or platforms. Keep in mind that spikes can't be dropped through platforms (which is why it's good for the tower downward-facing platforms mentioned earlier to have gaps). Another thing you can do is set up a spike trampoline. Spikes bounce off trampolines as well, like in the gif below. The idea is setting up a trampoline on top of your tower at an angle so that the spikes would be bounced off to mid or enemy territory. The spikes will instakill any player -- both teammates and enemies. Spikes will always land on the same spot (as long as the trampoline isn't moved, of course) This is a pretty fun way to kill people, but not that useful -- the stone would probably be better used for some base expansion, although if you find it fun then go ahead (just don't waste 300 stone in 10 seconds please!, especially if you're not the builder keeping your quarry running) 2.7 Defending from rats Rats (underground tunneling builders) can be unexpected and can cause your team to quickly lose, even if your team was doing fine and had control of mid. As a defensive builder you should always pay attention to the minimap and see if there are any suspicious tunnels being made under the mid or your base. As you can see, if someone is in a dark tunnel, his player marker won't appear on the minimap. However, you can see that blocks are being dug out below the red flag. Firstly, if you notice any rats coming near your base you should alert your team in the chat -- it's much safer to have some knight support. Secondly, buy a drill and a mine (or more than one). The best way to deal with rats is to have lots of mines in your base -- even if the enemies destroy them, mines will slow them down. If the rats start ratting towards your flag or part of your base, you can kill them with a mine. The idea is to place it on the ground and wait for the mine to deploy (remember that mines don't deploy if they're being constantly moved), then start drilling downwards to the enemies with the mine falling down, like in the gif below. This works the best if the rats are ratting upwards. It's also a good tactic against underground tunnels (the building) -- drilling down to them with a mine. Sometimes you can notice that there's an underground tunnel because the travelling enemy's character appears on your screen for a very short while, even if it's in a dark spot. Moreover, as you can see for a short while in the gif above, when you actually move your cursor on the enemy tunnel, it will say &quot;travel tunnel&quot;. So if you suspect that the enemy has any tunnels anywhere, you could move your mouse around and check. If you are fighting against rats at an even level, you should keep spamming doors and hope that knights will be able to kill them. It's good to take a lantern with you as well, in order to increase your knights' visibility. After you've dealt with the rats, you should deal with the tunnel they dug. If the tunnel will be of any use to your team, put lots of doors in it as well as mines (if you don't have money -- get lanterns instead so that your team can see if any enemies will try to use it again). Keep in mind that in the example gif above, the enemies were ratting in water. Doors decay quickly when placed in water, so after we deal with the rats we want to block the tunnel with stone blocks and platforms (platforms don't decay in water, unlike doors). If the tunnel won't be of use, you should block it with stone and platforms. Platforms are good for this because of the functionality mentioned earlier -- enemy builders' drills will overheat faster on them. Again, image of how you could do that is below. 2.8 Keg dropping Although you're a defensive builder, there are certain situations where it'd be better for you to change to knight and drop a keg to protect your tower. This is usually when enemies start getting into the bottom of your tower and they have placed protection from spikes (or if you're unable to spikedrop them for any other reason), as well as if there are no knights to kill them. Since building gives you a lot of coins, you can change to knight at a knight shop and buy a keg (120 coins), then light it and drop it at the enemies like in the gif below. Sometimes a good knight can catch the keg, so if you don't want that to happen you should suicide with it (jump and drop it right before falling to the ground while slashing for additional momentum). Remember that only knights can light kegs. 2.9 Being under siege If enemies are launching knights from catapults, it'd be good to make a wall that would stop the knights from getting over the tower, even if it's temporary and made from wood and only 1 block thick (although you should add some backwall to it as soon as possible). Besides from that, try to constantly repair any part of your tower damaged by the enemies. If there's no way to prevent the enemies from coming into your base, you should either change to knight and try to kill any incoming enemies. If you're able to reach the enemy catapult, change to archer and try to shoot a bomb arrow (50 coins, archer shop) at it. Enemies usually will land on the same spot of the wall on full catapult power, so if you see where they land you can place a spike on a wooden block there to damage them and make them fall down. This is better against builders -- while knights will just hug the wall and fall down, builders would be able to place ladders, so the spikes kill them. It's good to have a water bucket or a builder shop near this, so that you can extinguish any fires in case enemies use fire arrows against this. If you're under siege from ballista explosive bolts, you can also try to shoot bomb arrows at the ballista (keep in mind ballistas get destroyed after two bomb arrows, not one like catapults). If that's not possible, you should just constantly repair the part of your tower/base that is being hit by explosive bolts, even if only with wood. Another thing you can do is change to knight and slash the ballista bolts, although this requires good timing to make sure you don't get hit. 2.10 What to spend money on Since you're playing as a defensive builder, you're likely to not die often and get a lot of coins for building. There are a few ways on how to spend the money. The first thing you want to buy is siege -- a catapult and a ballista. As mentioned earlier, you could also spend coins to buy a lot of eggs and set up a chicken farm for launching your knights from the catapult further. If you have upgraded ballista bolts and they actually hit the enemy tower, you could keep buying additional bolts to fire from the ballista (100 coins for 6 explosive bolts in the siege shop -- one explosive bolt needs 2 standard bolts) After you buy these, you can pretty much only buy items for other players if you want to keep playing as a defensive builder. A good tactic is buying a lot of kegs at once next to your catapult and then launch your knights with them. If there's not that much space between your tower and the enemy tower, you could also make an archer shop and spam some bomb arrows at the opposing team's structures. You can also buy mines and then ask your teammates to take them and put them somewhere near enemy structures. "],["builder-iii-progressive-playstyle.html", "Chapter 3 Builder III: Progressive playstyle 3.1 What you're going to focus on 3.2 Mid control 3.3 Ratting 3.4 Coin farming (again)", " Chapter 3 Builder III: Progressive playstyle 3.1 What you're going to focus on Progressive builders mainly focus on gaining and keeping control of the middle of the map, and then on helping their team damage enemy structures. You can also think of coin-farmers and rats as progressive builders -- unlike offensive opportunistic builders, they plan their actions over time. 3.2 Mid control Having control of the middle is very important for the team -- your team can attack the enemy tower better and quicker if they're able to quickly travel to mid with a tunnel. 3.2.1 Start of the match The first thing you want to do when the build time over is to get to mid as a builder and place a tunnel (make sure you have one next to your tent first! -- preferably with a sawtrap). Prepare some materials before the build time ends -- at least 250 stone (100 stone for the tunnel + defences) and some wood (at least 400 -- 200 for tunnel and the rest for doors). The more mats -- the better. You can also take gold if you have some to be able to build it quicker (50 gold), and if not -- you will dig the gold out at mid. You can also take a drill if you'd like to mine out/dig out some parts of the mid faster. As you can see in the gif above, first we want to quickly make a workshop somewhere in the middle of the map and then build defenses for it -- doors (with at least one stone door) and stone blocks. If the middle of the map has any underground spots, build the tunnel here -- dirt acts well as a natural defense against kegs and such. If the middle is flat, make sure there's enough stone blocks so that a good knight won't quickly get into the tunnel with explosives. 3.2.2 Upkeep and further expansion Once the tunnel is built, you want to upkeep control of mid. Go back to your tent to get some materials from the storage (or just dig some more if there's none in the storage) You should turn your mid base into basically your second front tower -- add some shops (especially food shop and knight shop) and a front wall with lots of doors and maybe some platforms. You should eventually buy a ballista for quicker respawn as well. Make sure it has lots of protection so that the enemies don't destroy or capture it easily. You can put it in the same spot as the tunnel (if you don't plan to fire it at the enemies). Ballistas need 5x5 blocks of space. Here's an example of a decent mid base: As you can see, it's pretty solid -- it has a respawn ballista, a tunnel and shops, as well as lots of doors. Moreover it's made in the middle of a hill, so there's lots of additional dirt protection as well. One thing that could be improved is making additional doors to the top, as well as additional defences on the top in general; as you can see, a blue builder could block the only top doors and then drill downwards through dirt to the ballista and tunnel (blue arrow). If the map is small enough, you could also connect the mid base with your tower (similar to how defensive base expansion explained in previous chapter works). This will make it even harder for the enemies to take it back. All of the stuff from the previous chapter applies to managing a mid base and making a good mid tower, including using spikes, keg dropping, base expansion and so on. One difference is that you're going to have to repair much more often and fight more enemies, and sometimes you probably should change to knight if your team isn't doing very well. Mine spam is advised as well. Depending on how big the map is, you may also want to have siege on top of your mid base -- ballista with explosive bolts and catapult for launching knights. 3.2.3 Taking mid from the enemies Sometimes the mid rush at the start of the game can fail and the enemy team could take mid. At that point, your goal as a progressive builder is to pretty much take control of mid. This will require you to be a bit aggressive, and even though combat is mostly going to be mentioned in the next chapter, it's good that you know some basics. First of all, the first step to taking control of mid is destroying or capturing the enemy's ballista (for respawn) or the tunnel (used for quick travel). You should look at what the mid base looks like -- what are its weaknesses, how many doors does it have, and what would be the easiest way to get into the ballista/tunnel. One thing you should do is find a path to there which would require the least effort and would not require too many doorfights, which can get you easily killed -- start destroying enemy doors only if it's the fastest or the only way to get to your destination. For example, in the image below, you shouldn't try to go through the doors (red square) -- it will take a lot of time and enemy knights are likely to kill you. What you should do is block the doors with a stone block and then drill through the 1 layer of stone blocks above (green arrow) -- that would be the fastest way to get into the part with the tunnel. It's hard to take a mid base entirely by yourself -- the CTF mode is a team mode after all. First, you need to pay attention to how your knights are doing. Whenever some skirmishes near mid base happens, you should wait and see which team gains advantage. You should start pushing mid as soon as you see that your knights &amp; archers are winning the fight. When you finally get to the enemy ballista or tunnel, as you can see in the gif, you want to make lots of doors for your knights. Spamming doors when taking any enemy structure is very important. They're very helpful to your knights. Of course, this also means that you want to have lots of wood when pushing. You should make the doors right next to the tunnel so that the enemies can't block them. Also, you want to block all enemy doors. If you have knights with you, enemies that will travel by the tunnel will usually be quickly killed by them due to stun from travelling, and dead enemies won't be able to respawn on a ballista that is being captured. However, other enemy knights that are in other parts of mid may be able to still kill you. If there's some space between the tunnel itself and enemy doors -- just block them with stone blocks (generally try to not use doors -- your knights may open them accidentally). In most cases there won't be any space between entrances and the tunnel, so you want to remove one door from each pair as fast as possible and quickly place a stone block. If you see any enemy knights coming and you know that you won't be able to block them fast enough, you should retreat behind your own doors and let your knights handle the situation. Either way, you should help your knight with destroying the tunnel -- although slashes do a lot of damage to a tunnel, drilling or just mining a tunnel is still going to be very helpful. When pushing any enemy structure, speed is important too. Unless the mid base is sparsely protected with only a few doors, you probably always want to have a drill for faster digging. This may require you to mine out some stone sometimes or make use of your quarry, or wait for more resupplies. Keep in mind that you generally do not want to drill doors. They overheat the drill too quickly -- you should destroy almost all doors by hand (unless you need to destroy them really quickly to avoid getting killed by the enemy or if speed is important, or if there's no other way to getting to the tunnel). Same for platforms. However, you should drill out solid blocks. Try to select a path that will be the least dangerous (even if it means getting to enemy tunnel a bit slower). For example, if a tunnel is underground like in the image below, in most cases you shouldn't go on top of it and try getting through all these enemy defenses. Going through the dirt by ratting (green arrow), even if a bit slow, is more likely to be successful. Of course, you're not likely to instantly succeed after your first try. The point is to keep putting pressure on the enemies and not let them have too much time to repair, eventually letting you retake mid. After the tunnel is destroyed, you have 2 options regarding what to do. If it's relatively safe around and you have protection, you can make your own tunnel in the place of the old enemy one, and then slowly retake the rest of the mid base. Of course, it depends on how big the mid base actually is -- if it's just a few layers of stone blocks and some doors, this shouldn't be hard to do. However, if the mid base is rather big and there are still lots of enemies around, making your own tunnel wouldn't be that good of an idea. In this case you may want to take the gold that the destroyed tunnel dropped and take it to your base's storage -- although gold isn't that rare on some maps, taking it away from the enemies will be an annoyance to them. Of course, this may all seem a bit confusing to a less advanced builder. Don't worry -- playing offensive requires more practice than theory. Eventually you'll instinctually know how you should react to certain situations and what you should do -- you can treat this section as some good general advice that you should keep in mind when pushing. Keep practicing and don't give up. 3.3 Ratting Ratting -- tunneling underground as a builder -- is a major tactic in KAG, viable on almost all the maps. Although some consider it a cheesy tactic, if done well a proper rat attempt can end an hour-long stalemate, even if your team was losing. It's time-consuming, but also hard to counter. 3.3.1 Where to start making your rat tunnel and how deep should it be It's important to pick a good spot for starting your rat tunnel. First, it depends on where you want to rat to and if you control mid. If you want to rat to the enemy flag + you have control of mid, then starting the tunnel from under your own tower would be pointless. Moreover, if your tunneling attempt fails, enemies will be able to take the tunnel and use it against you. Which means that you don't want to start it next to a flag. Starting it next to your tent is also pointless -- you're going to waste time on digging through an area that entirely belongs to your team. If you have mid, you should start making your tunnel somewhere there. It depends on how much you plan to be ratting for and if you'd rather be safer than faster, as well as on the amount of blocks you'll need to dig out to get to enemy territory. Still, be careful -- if the enemies will take the tunnel, they'll gain access to middle of the map. Generally, if you're not going to be ratting that far (on small maps), you don't need to go that deep. However, for bigger maps, you could choose to go as deep as possible -- so that the enemies have a harder time countering you from above. Ratting only 4-5 blocks deep is also viable, and if successful you will get to your destination faster, but it's also easier to counter. 3.3.2 When to rat You don't really need to rat on every map every time -- especially if your team is doing very well overground. Keep in mind that ratting can split your team -- if other builders start coming with you, and eventually also knights, there will be less people to attack the enemy tower above the ground as well as less people to protect your mid base. Sometimes it's better to keep putting on pressure rather than start ratting. Ratting can take a long time as well, especially if your first attempt fails and you want to keep going on. 3.3.3 Stealthy ratting or not? If you want to be stealthy (at least for some time), there are obviously some things you shouldn't do that will make you visible for the enemies, for example: Using a lantern -- makes you visible to pretty much everyone Using emotes Typing outside of team chat -- typing in general chat by pressing T makes a chat bubble. This does not happen if you use team chat instead (clicking Y instead). Although that's obvious, the question is if you even want to be stealthy. As mentioned in the previous chapter, you can easily see on the minimap if there's a rat tunnel. It's not that hard to notice enemy tunnels. Using a drill is also a massive advantage -- it speeds up the process a lot if done well (will be explained soon), but it also produces light and make the tunnel more noticable to enemies. Moreover -- sometimes you actually want your ratting to be noticed. Using emotes and letting the entire enemy team know that you're ratting can cause a lot of enemies to focus on you and try to counter the tunneling, while not paying as much attention to the rest of their base. Diversive tunnels are a great tactic if your team can push well overground -- especially if you can keep defending the tunnel for as long as possible, getting as many enemies as possible to you. 3.3.4 Managing your rat tunnel First, you want to place a builder shop at the bottom of the tunnel. You can return to it every 20 seconds to get resupplies. You may also want to place a knight shop. It's good to place a lot of mines in case the enemies take the tunnel. You should also obviously spam lots of doors -- the more wood you have the better. Remember to put stone backwall behind all doors. Tunnels are one of the only places where a trap could actually be effective as well (since it's dark). You could place a trap somewhere in there as well -- a saw and some teambridges. (Left side is how it looks naturally in-game, right side is brightened) 3.3.5 Placing a tunnel Eventually, if you get closer to your destination -- for example, somewhere close to the flag, you should place a tunnel for faster travel. Of course, you need to have gold, stone and wood for it first, which is why you should prepare some materials (especially gold, you can eventually get 100 stone from resupplies on a builder shop but bringing some is good too) before starting ratting. This will let reinforcements arrive quickly (knights) as well as allow you to get to base quicker after you take the flag. Make sure to place lots of doors around the tunnel. At that point the enemies will probably already have noticed you and will start anti-ratting efforts. If you're lacking knight support, you should definitely mention that in the chat (preferably in team chat). 3.3.6 Using a drill Drilling makes making long rat tunnels much easier due to how much faster you can dig through the ground, especially if it's 2 or more builders drilling. Drills obviously will overheat somewhat quickly, but that's not a problem. The other reason for why we want a builder shop near is so that we can constantly buy water buckets. One water bucket can produce 3 water splashes (as mentioned in first chapter, press left mouse button while holding one to do that) which will instantly cool down the drill. The idea is to get a drill and use a water bucket on it as soon as it overheats. If you have a knight with you, you should ask him to pick up water buckets after you buy them and use them. If you're ratting solo, you can do it yourself. There's also another trick regarding ratting with drills -- you can bring down some water if the map has some and place a stone door so that it only fills up the bottom layer. This will constantly cool down the drill so that it doesn't overheat. However, keep in mind that this will cause you to drill slower (drills work slower in water), so for maximum efficiency I recommend actually going one layer above it and cooling down the drill when needed, like in gif below. Despite making you easily noticable to enemies, using drills can make ratting a much more stronger tactic. I do this almost always whenever I decide to rat (although I mostly play as an offensive builder overground). 3.3.7 Doorfights As mentioned in the earlier chapter, doorfights can happen -- this is when both teams spam doors next to each other and try to destroy the opposing doors, as well as kill the enemies. When it gets to the point of a doorfight, you can't do that much besides relying on your knights. If it's a dark tunnel and there's a builder shop near, you should get a lantern -- since the enemies already know you're here, it'll just increase your knights' visibility. You should spam doors and be careful to not die -- if you see that any of your knights is going to open your doors and attempt to kill the enemies, you should back off to not die. Another thing you can do is going around. You could drill two blocks up or down and then to the side. After that you could attempt to block the enemies and have your knights directly attack them or keep going to the enemy flag while defending from enemies at the same time. For example, in the gif below, we try go around the red doors because there's way too many of them (as well as a lot of enemies) You can also place a mine in your door and then wait for enemies to get to it. Sometimes they won't notice it and will walk into it, instantly dying. 3.3.8 Getting to the flagroom Getting to the flagroom can be quite tricky due to enemy knight slash angles. Basically, when you're ratting upwards like in the image below, and the flagroom has no doors on the part where you're ratting, you will have to destroy the four blocks in the red square in the image below to get to the flagroom. However, this is quite problematic -- because after you destroy the first two blocks, place doors and go up, enemy knights in the flagroom would be able to slash you if you're in a place like this: You could consider not placing the doors then and try to destroy the blocks from a distance where knights wouldn't be able to slash you. However, this is viable only if there are no enemy builders in the enemy flag room -- if you don't place doors they will just place stone blocks there or their own doors. What you want to do is go slightly to the side so that you can replace enemy stone blocks with doors without getting damaged by the enemy knights, like in the gif below. Of course, sometimes flag rooms have entrances from both sides. That's a bit harder to rat to because it's easier for the enemies to kill you. In this case you need to mostly rely on your knights to kill the enemies (spam doors when possible as well). Sometimes when you try to drill through solid blocks (such as stone), the enemy may have a lot of materials and constantly repair it. There's a little &quot;unintended feature&quot; which will allow you to bypass that -- if you place horizontal ladders like in the gif below, they won't be able to repair the blocks anymore (and neither will you be able to damage the blocks by normal pickaxe). You will still be able to drill through the blocks, though. Keep in mind that knights howevver will be able to slash and destroy the ladders through the wall if there are any, so it may take a few tries. 3.4 Coin farming (again) Similar to defensive builders, if you keep expanding your mid base, you will eventually get lots of coins. Again, you can decide to buy siege, ballista bolts or kegs for your team on mid. Some builders try to die as rarely as possible and try to gather 400 or more coins then use all of it at once by doing bomb arrow spam. You build an archer nest with some platforms like on the gif below, buy a lot of bomb arrows at once and then fire it at the enemy base. This is similar to spamming bomb arrows as a defensive builder, but as a builder that mostly sticks to mid you are able to actually be more precise and aim them to cause a bit more damage. "],["builder-iv-offensive-playstyle.html", "Chapter 4 Builder IV: Offensive playstyle 4.1 What you're going to focus on 4.2 Preparation before pushing 4.3 Material scavenging 4.4 Observing other players 4.5 Pushing 4.6 Combat 4.7 Playing with a knight friend", " Chapter 4 Builder IV: Offensive playstyle 4.1 What you're going to focus on Offensive builders mainly focus on constantly putting pressure on the enemy, pushing (both with knights and solo), with the goal of seriously damaging enemy structures or getting to the enemy flag, while trying to be as much of an annoyance to the enemies as possible. 4.2 Preparation before pushing Like all builders, offensive builders also need a lot of materials to push. Unlike other kinds of builders, you're likely to die more often, so you will also need to take materials from your base more often too. This is why you want a few trees in a tree farm -- as many as possible -- and a quarry that's constantly running. If nobody is setting up these things -- you should do it yourself so that you can push efficiently. If nobody in your team is putting wood in the quarry, then you should do that every time you respawn as well. For pushing, we usually want at least 600 wood (but you can as well go with 1000 if you have lots of wood or trees) and a drill (you want to have one almost every time you push). Having some stone -- usually somewhere between 100 and 200, but if you have more then you can take even up to 500 -- can also be a big advantage for blocking enemy doors. 4.3 Material scavenging You're actually going to try to use as many of your materials as possible before getting killed (because that's how most pushes end up, and you want as many coins as possible). Since our materials are going to be used pretty fast, you want to scavenge any additional materials you can find on the map. Holding C will highlight all materials and other items useful to you on the map. If some materials are stuck in a 1 block wide gap, like in the gif below, sometimes you won't be able to pick it up. You can however use a trick to get it closer to you -- just place blocks until it goes up. If you have too many materials and there are additional materials laying around, you can quickly use some of what you have -- you can do that by making simple improvements to the mid base or to the tower. This provides lots of coins which can eventually be used for some offensive tactics when you succeed in a push. 4.4 Observing other players Offensive playstyle will often require you to try to teamwork with random players in your team, as well as often fight against enemies -- both builders and knights. To be more efficient, you should pay attention to who are the best knights in your team -- so that you can rely on them if you're pushing together, as well as know who in your team isn't that advanced and often repeats the same mistakes (such as opening your doors and accidentally letting enemies kill you). You should also observe how good the enemies are and watch what they are doing -- does the opposing team have any good builder? What are they doing -- do they have a plan and try to base expand, gain control of mid or what? Pay attention to the enemy knights as well -- the best knights in the enemy team are also the most likely to kill you and prevent you from succeeding, so you should be wary of them. 4.5 Pushing As an offensive builder you will want to push at the enemy structures most of the time. There's a lot that you should keep in mind here. 4.5.1 Skipping mid or not? Sometimes the enemy may have control of mid, and that can in certain situations be advantageous to you and give you an opportunity to win with a surprise attack. Basically, if the enemies are focused on keeping control of mid and attacking the enemy structures, as well as ratting sometimes, their tower -- and the flagroom -- is likely to not be well-defended. This happens especially if there's a respawn ballista at a mid base; if you get to the enemy base, you're less likely to get noticed because people are respawning at mid instead of the base. This can cause teams to lose sometimes because of a single builder and one or two knights. The idea is that you want to go through mid and ignore the enemy ballista or tunnel while not getting too much attention (unless you want to get attention and distract the enemies so that your team can regain control of mid). There's a lot that can happen -- sometimes nobody will even go after you, most of the time only two or three knights will try to get to you, while sometimes it'll be the entire enemy team. However, if the enemy team doesn't chase after you or if it's a single person, that's a big opportunity for you. As with any other push, you should focus on doing as much damage as possible or maybe even try to get the flag -- and if that fails, just survive the longest and distract as many enemies as possible. Sometimes you can skip mid by getting launched from a catapult at the top of your tower -- if that's possible, you could even get gold and attempt to build a tunnel in the enemy base. However, keep in mind that you don't always want to skip mid. If your team has problems with defending the tower, you should help with defending or getting control of mid. 4.5.2 Building quick wooden walls, ledges Sometimes you may want to quickly make wooden walls in order to skip enemy knights or just not get damaged by them. We're doing it with wood because as mentioned in the first chapter, wood doesn't need as much support from the ground as stone blocks, so we can make over 20 blocks long ledges. This is a great mobility trick that allows you to get past gaps with enemies. 4.5.3 Building food shops As we mentioned earlier, we want lots of wood for pushing. If you have lots of wood and you get damaged -- by a slash or any enemy arrow -- you should make a food shop and quickly heal. Doesn't matter where you place the food shop -- you can as well place it as soon as you get damaged. You can also make some quick defenses around it if enemy archers are constantly shooting at you. The point is that you should try to not die until you use up all your materials (to get coins, but to not feed the materials to the enemy as well), so there's no point in saving the wood. 4.5.4 Analysing enemy tower and making a plan Pushing is about constantly keeping up pressure and trying to achieve something. It's good to have at least a general goal on what you want to do -- do you want to go on top of the enemy tower and make a knight shop there (and spam kegs if you have coins)? Or maybe you want to collapse a part of it? Or do you just want to annoy the enemies and block all the doors? Or maybe just constantly drill into the flag defenses until one time you are successful? These are all viable options and we will talk about them in the next sections. Whenever you're in a match, you should look at the enemy tower and analyse its weaknesses to make a plan of action -- for example: How many doors does the tower have? How hard would it be to block them all? Is there any part of the tower that is made of just stone blocks and would be easily drillable? Is there any easy way to get into the enemy knight shop? Is there a tunnel or a ballista on top? How hard would it be to get on top of the enemy tower? How hard would the tower be to collapse by using various tactics (for example, by bomb arrow spam or just collapsing by destroying backwalls)? Here are some examples of towers (I tried to pick somewhat good ones, but it's still public CTF) I spotted on random matches on public CTF and what I would do against them as an offensive builder: This is a pretty good tower -- it's not worth trying to go to the top with your team because there's way too many doors, and even if you managed to get there you can't do much damage. It's also not that easy to collapse. Howver, there's an obvious weakness -- the bottom is very sparsely protected and has no doors. What I would do is make some defenses for myself at the bottom (stone blocks + doors -- yellow colour), then drill through (the arrow) and then quickly block all the enemy doors with stone blocks then drill into the flag. If you have an opportunity and there are no enemy knights, you could also attempt to get the enemy keg to do some damage to the tower (and buy more kegs if you have coins). It's a decent tower with lots of doors, a ballista and a tunnel, but yet again the bottom doesn't have much protection. What I would do is get through to the bottom part, block all doors with stone blocks (yellow colour) and try to get to the flag (green arrows) For this tower we have 2 things we could do. For the first variant, if there are not many enemies, you could try climbing up with ladders (green lines) and then get to the ballista (green arrow) while blocking all enemy doors with stone blocks (yellow colour). You can capture the ballista or destroy it. After that, you can drill down to the flag while blocking all enemy doors as well and go back the same way you got in. The 2nd option is if there are lots of enemies on top that would most likely kill you -- in this case, we place one ladder on the wall, then make some defences around us (2 layers from top -- see 4.5.12) as well as a door from bottom, and then drill to the flag while trying to make use of the corner trick (see 4.6.1) and blocking enemy doors It's good to also look at the enemy tower and try to analyse its weaknesses whenever you die and wait for respawn. 4.5.5 Observing knight fights Similarly to taking mid, the best way to damage enemy tower or get the enemy flag is teamwork -- so you need to know when your knights are succeeding in skirmishes. You should watch how your knights are doing when fighting under the enemy tower or on enemy terrain; check if good knights from your team are there. As soon as they kill the enemies and the opposing team's defense is somewhat weakened, you should start pushing with them. Try to be fast -- the defeated enemies will eventually respawn and get back there. Your knights won't always succeed though; if they are defeated by enemy knights, you will have to find a less direct way to get to the enemy structures. Sometimes it's better to just retreat and wait for your knights to come back. You should also watch out for bombs from the enemies -- they may decide to throw some at you and damage or kill you. 4.5.6 Killing enemy builders for materials This applies pretty much every time, especially if you have a drill or you have knights with you -- try to kill the enemy builders and get their materials. The more materials you use, the more effective you can be at supporting your knights by spamming doors and spikes, as well as farming coins for buying kegs or making ledges. For example, in the gif below I was missing wood to build a knight shop, so I killed a builder which had some wood. 4.5.7 Scaling the enemy tower -- wallclimbing with stone or wood blocks You can spam stone blocks below you while constantly jumping and wallclimb the enemy tower. This is usually done when you're pushing solo or there are lots of enemy knights; you also block lots of doors by doing this. Of course, you can do it with wood blocks as well, but they're much easier to destroy for the enemy builders (as well as knights), so they're less effective. If your goal is just to get to the top of the tower however, then feel free to do it. 4.5.8 Scaling the enemy tower -- ladders Scaling the enemy tower with ladders is most effective if the enemy tower doesn't have many doors and if you have knight support with you. Sometimes after placing a few ladders, enemy knights may try to come to you from below. This is a good opportunity to drop spikes and kill them. Keep in mind that in certain situations your vertically placed ladders can fall off. This happens if you try to place them next to a single block while there's no backwall either; in order to not fall off, the bottom part of the ladder needs to be placed next to a block as well. This usually happens if you blocked enemy doors and then try building ladders over it. However, there's a simple solution -- you can just rotate the ladders and place them horizontally. They don't fall off in this situation. When you get to the upper parts of the tower by ladder placing, sometimes enemies wil come to the top and will may try to kill you. In this case you want to build a ledge over your head (so that they don't jump down on you) with some doors for your knights, as well as some additional side defenses in case enemy knights still try to jump off and slash you from the side. In a situation like that you can either wait for your knights to defeat the enemies or start mining/drilling into the side of the tower. 4.5.9 Scaling the enemy tower with blocks + ladders The best way to climb usually is combining the 2 ways -- blocking doors with stone blocks, but placing ladders as well. As mentioned a few sentences ago, use vertical ladders for single blocks. 4.5.10 Scaling the enemy tower -- platforms Some builders sometimes decide to use platforms facing upwards. This can provide some defense from enemy knights jumping down (as well as from spikes if you place two platforms for each time) and lets your knights climb the tower as well, but keep in mind that platforms are easily destroyable by enemy knights (and sometimes they're able to slash through them as well) and that climbing them is slower than climbing ladders. Moreover, placing platforms is slightly slower than solid stone or wood blocks. Keep in mind this is mostly a tactic to annoy the enemies, rather than actually climbing the tower. 4.5.11 Getting launched from a catapult You can sometimes get yourself launched from a catapult at your mid base or main tower. If you manage to get to the enemy wall, you should place ladders as soon as possible. Same advice as regarding scaling enemy tower with ladders applies here. You can hold a chicken for additional distance as well. Sometimes you can even get launched to the top of the enemy tower. Another fun thing you can do is get into a crate (hold the crate and press E) and have it picked up by a knight, which is then launched from a catapult. 4.5.12 Going into the bottom of the tower Of course, you won't always want to climb the tower, especially if you can get the flag in an easier way. Sometimes if the bottom of the tower is sparsely defended you can try going in there. A good way is to make some small defences at the bottom of the tower and then start mining/drilling towards it, like in the gif below. Let's look at this defense: As you can see, we're only making one entrance from the side -- this is because enemy builders will often try to drop a spike from above and kill you; if there were doors, some knight in your team could open it on accident and get you killed. Why do we want two layers of stone blocks from the top? -- If there was only one layer, an enemy knight could kill you with a bomb. This is because bombs can kill you through one layer of solid blocks. This doesn't happen with platforms or with doors (the doors get damaged and absorb all the damage -- keep in mind that a bomb doesn't even destroy the door fully, it just damages it to around 20% health). Making 2 layers of solid block defenses in any situation when we're surrounded by enemies requires the enemy knights to use at least 2 bombs and greatly increases our chance of survival, giving us some more time to reposition ourselves or get a bit further into the tower. When we're inside the tower, standard doorfight tactics apply -- just spam doors and rely on your knights. However, don't trust your knights too much in some cases -- for example, you should block top doors with stone blocks instead of doors if you're going to the side, because your knights could open them accidentally and get you killed. 4.5.13 Destroying mines You should also watch out for mines and destroy any you see. It takes two pickaxe hits to destroy every mine. However, there's one bug you should watch out for -- if a mine is stuck in a 1 block wide hole, like in the gif below, hitting it from below will cause it to go through the hole somehow. What you want to do in situations like this is either block or ignore the mine (if you have knights near you that could accidentally die on the mine), or if possible -- hit the mine, quickly move away, then hit it again, like in the gif below. 4.5.14 Being on top of tower After getting to the top of the enemy tower, there are various things you can do. First thing you want to do is block all the enemy doors. Make sure to build a ledge with doors from the side you came from as well so that the enemies don't get to you from there either. If you have lots of coins, now is a good moment to use them. What you can do is quickly build a tall wall and a knight shop on top of it, change to knight and then buy kegs and drop them down. Use up all your materials before changing to knight for as many coins as possible. If there are enemy knights that could collapse the wall, you should use stone instead of wood for the bottom part of it. You can use some additional backwalls too or place some ladders for your knights as well. Sometimes people will have a very high column of ladders in their tower, without any additional doors. You can use this to your advantage by dropping a spike and killing a lot of people (Also, if your tower has that too, you should fix that). Of course you can do that much more easily if the enemy tower has lots of backwalls and not many solid blocks. 4.5.15 Destroying enemy tunnel Pretty much same advice here applies as regarding destroying mid base tunnel; however, there's one additional thing that you can do if the tunnel is on top of the enemy tower. Basically, collapsing blocks destroy doors and shops when they fall down. You can make a chunk of wood supported by one backwall and then collapse it like in the gif below to destroy enemy doors and shops. This can sometimes apply in other situations too -- for example for destroying a mid tunnel. You can also do this when there are no doors, but this will require destroying a block like in the gif below. Keep in mind that this only applies to doors. If you ever find yourself in a situation like this but on the defense, you can counter it by just replacing your top doors with wood or stone blocks. 4.5.16 Buying kegs in enemy knight shop Although spamming kegs from top of the tower is good, in some situations buying them in the middle of the enemy base will be more effective. The idea is to get to the enemy knight shop and buy some kegs, then light as many as you can. One keg's explosion will light the other kegs and you will do a lot of damage to the enemy tower. Sometimes enemies will buy a water bucket and extinguish the kegs (even through doors). If this happens, just light the keg again. There's one thing you should also know -- if a keg explodes near a shop, the shop is going to absorb some of the damage from the keg and the backwall behind the shop won't be damaged. This means that in some cases you will actually need at least 2 kegs for even a thin tower (unless you destroy the shops first) 4.5.17 Collapsing the tower Besides using kegs, you can try to collapse the tower in a different way. If you have a lot of knights with you, but getting to the flag at the current moment would be a bit tricky, you should definitely attempt to collapse the tower. The best way to collapse a tower is to try to notice the fastest way of destroying its support and noticing kind of a line. Example &quot;line&quot; is the highlighted blocks in the image below -- destroying these blocks (if you don't have a drill for solid blocks) would be the fastest way to collapse. You want to use a drill for solid blocks such as wood or stone (try to find a &quot;line&quot; with as many as possible -- of course if you have a drill), avoid wasting time on destroying doors unless necessary and finish by destroying backwalls. If you don't have a drill, focus on backwalls only. There's a trick which lets you destroy backwalls quicker: basically, if you hit a stone backwall one time with your pickaxe, you can replace it with a wooden backwall, which is then much easier to destroy than a slightly damaged stone backwall. Comparison: With replacement, one stone backwall takes 1 hit, replacement, 2 more hits to destroy Without replacement, one stone backwall takes 5 hits to destroy 4.5.18 Using enemy tunnels Not that strictly related to pushing, but sometimes you can use an enemy tunnel (for example their mid base one) to travel to another one (tent one or tower one). However, you should be careful and check earlier (for example when waiting for respawn) if the enemy tunnel you're travelling to has a sawtrap. You should be wary of enemy mines on the tunnels as well (they'll instantly kill you). There's also a trick that can actually let you avoid sawtraps. The idea is to place a ladder in the room with the tunnel and while climbing both vertically and horizontally on the ladder (holding W + A/D) use the tunnel. This will make you move slightly after teleporting to the other tunnel and avoid the sawtrap. Other players in your team can do this as well. In the gif above, you would get killed in the saw if you used the tunnel without the ladder trick. This however can also be countered if the spot with the sawtrap is 6 blocks wide and has two sawtraps instead of only one. 4.5.19 Falling down on collapsing blocks If you're on a ledge high over the ground, sometimes you may want to go to the bottom. You can collapse 2-3 wooden blocks and then fall down on them slowly to not get any fall damage. 4.5.20 Making a tunnel in the middle of the enemy base Sometimes you can end up destroying the tunnel in the enemy tower and may have gold. If you have other mats, you can try building a tunnel for your own team. This is a bit risky, but if done well it can cause a quick victory. You can combine it with the ladder trick from &quot;Using enemy tunnels&quot; section as well. In the gif below, first I travelled to it by using the ladder trick, then destroyed it and used the gold to make my own. 4.6 Combat Although builder isn't a combat class, as an offensive builder you want to be somewhat good at killing people for maximum effectiveness as well (it's also quite fun). 4.6.1 Using doors at certain corner angles to damage knights This is arguably the most powerful combat trick for builders; there's a certain angle which lets you damage knights by pickaxe and drills without them being able to damage you by slashes. In the image below, the knight is unable to damage you by slashing (unless by a generally unknown trick that I'll mention later), while you're able to damage them by a pickaxe or drill. Basically, the way it works is that whenever a knight attack a door, the door absorbs the damage of the slash/jab and the slash/jab's arc (which starts from the top) doesn't continue past the door. In this situation, the knight can only attack the door. You can however still attack them. You can often force yourself into such situations by being at a lower level than the enemy players and placing doors properly. Knights will often think that they should be able to damage you and get closer to you. You can also place a block behind them when they get close so that they don't run away. Make sure to not open the door accidentally -- the enemies can go through it and then be able to kill you. Now, the thing is, that the enemy knight is actually able to slash you by starting his slash so that it doesn't hit the door and then moving the slash arc to hit the enemy builder (starting the slash from the opposite side and quickly moving the direction he's pointing to by 180 degrees with his mouse downwards, not hitting the door at all) However, barely anyone knows about this and you'll be able to kill a majority of the knights without getting any damage. This angle works similar in a situation like in the gif below as well, but if the knight doesn't aim directly at you they may sometimes damage you. It's also a bit more dangerous to try damaging them at this angle because it's easier to accidentally open the door. Keep in mind that enemy builders can attack you at both of these angles -- it's just knights who can't. 4.6.2 Enemy knights glitching in the doors Sometimes if you open doors for a short moment for the enemy knights and they have slight lag, they will get stuck in a closed door and you will be able to damage them while they won't be able to. 4.6.3 Pickaxe 1v1 with other builders Whenever you're doing a 1v1 with other builders, you should try to spike them first somehow to get a heart advantage and then finish them with a pickaxe. If you don't have any way to do that, then the result of the 1v1 will depend on whoever damaged the enemy player first. To do that, you should start attacking them with your pickaxe as soon as they're in your range. Another way to win the 1v1 is to heal yourself -- eat a burger, a fish or use a heart to heal yourself after losing some health. You can eat it by using the Eat Food bind (V key by default). Try to use food at as low health as possible, because the enemy may have food too. In the gif below, I eat a burger with the V key right after getting hit 5 times (so one hit away from death -- half a heart). Generally try to not engage in pickaxe 1v1s if you have fewer hearts than the enemy. Spamming the right mouse button instead of holding it makes no difference. 4.6.4 Pickaxe through door corners You're able to hit the enemy in situations like in the gif below with your pickaxe if you aim at the right spot and position yourself properly. Example of how it can be used in actual gameplay: 4.6.5 Heating drill before combat Since the drill does more damage when at least 50% heated, sometimes before engaging in a 1v1 with a builder that has a drill you may want to heat your own drill slightly for more damage (1.5 heart of damage instead of 1). You can do it by using it for a moment on any blocks. Keep in mind that the drill usually overheats after that (if it was heated to the point of doing more damage) and will drop to the ground, so don't do this if there are more than one enemy builder around. 4.6.6 Hiding drill from enemy builder You can try to make the enemy builder think that you have no drill by keeping it in your inventory and provoke them to attack you, and then take it out and kill them. 4.6.7 Baiting and overheating enemy builder's drill Sometimes you may want to not fight against a builder with a drill -- especially if you don't have one yourself. The idea is to bait them and get them to drill doors in a doorfight -- spam lots of doors. They may overheat their drill on your doors. You want to wait a short while (you can't pick up a drill right after it overheated and dropped to the ground) -- about half a second -- and pick it up from the ground. You can also try to use the drill to kill the enemy right after. However, in most cases it'll overheat again right after using it. Try to pick it up and press the left mouse button once as quickly as possible, and then finish the enemy with normal pickaxe hits. If you already had a drill, you can just attack the enemy right after their drill got overheated. 4.6.8 Spamming overheated drill If you get stuck in a place with enemies but there's an overheated drill on the ground, you should hold right mouse button (to damage enemies with pickaxe) while spamming C and left mouse button at the same time to quickly damage enemies with the steaming drill before it falls down again. Keep in mind that picking up a steaming overheated drill does 0.25 heart of damage, so don't do this if you don't have enough health. 4.6.9 Using ladders against encased builder Often there will be an enemy builder encasing themselves with lots of mats. Getting to them even with a drill may take some time -- they can just constantly repair the blocks. However, as mentioned in the section 3.3.8 -- Getting to the flagroom, you can place ladders next to the blocks, which prevents them from repairing it, but still letting you drill through. 4.6.10 Killing knights with low health You can easily kill knights that have low health (1 heart), even with your pickaxe -- attack them in between their slashes (wait for them to miss a slash, then attack). 4.6.11 Offensive spiking You can drop spikes at enemies in a lot of situations. You can make use of the door-related corner angle mentioned earlier as well. Some examples are in the gifs below Waiting for enemy to open door before dropping spike (spikes go through opened doors): 4.6.12 Dirt spikes against enemies digging down If the enemies are digging down towards you, you can place some spikes on dirt (or on wood) right before they fall down and damage them. This can of course be countered by placing ladders, but it still works sometimes. 4.6.13 Escape spikes If you're escaping from a knight and there's some backwall around, you can drop spikes as the enemy is going towards you and damage them or even kill them. You can also place some ladders and spike them as they get close. 4.6.14 Double hit spikes Spikes can deal two hearts of damage by hitting the same enemy twice. If the enemy is jumping towards you, you should place a spike below them slightly to the side right as they fall down. They will be hit by the spike from the side and then the spike will hit them again, like in the gif below. 4.6.15 Collapsing blocks on enemies Collapsing blocks do a lot of damage, even to shielding knights. A good trick is to make some ladders and then some wood blocks -- the enemy knights will likely destroy the ladders and cause the wood blocks to collapse on themselves. One collapsing block does 1.5 heart of damage. 3 blocks are enough to kill a knight. A horizontal collapsing platform also kills knights because in most cases the knight will get hit by 3 blocks. 4.6.16 Stomping You can fall down on enemy builders (as well as knights, but that's a bit more dangerous) to stomp them while dealing some damage and stunning them. You can combine it with using a spike right after (if there's backwall), drilling them or hitting them with your pickaxe. 4.6.17 Crouching Crouching is when you hold down the S (move down) button. This causes your collision hitbox to disappear -- enemies will be able to go through you. You can't move for this to work (if you move, they'll collide with you even if you hold S), but you can still attack (by pickaxe or by using a drill). This can be used to avoid being stomped by enemies. You can also attack enemies that get stunned from fall damage right after crouching. 4.6.18 Dirt spike + crouch This doesn't work very often, but if enemies are digging downwards towards you, you can place dirtspikes (spikes on dirt/bedrock/wood etc.) below yourself and then crouch and have them fall down into the spikes. You can then jump out right after they get damaged and block them. 4.6.19 Catching and throwing back enemy bombs Enemy knights can sometimes throw a bomb too early or die right after lighting a bomb and give you enough time to catch it and throw it somewhere else. In the gif below, I've quickly caught the bomb and threw it at a distance so that it would only do 1.5 hearts of damage instead of instantly killing me. (Unrelated, but you can also notice crouching to not get stomped by enemy) If you're being attacked by several enemies at once, you can catch an enemy bomb and suicide with it to try to kill some enemies. In the gif below, I pick up the enemy bomb at the last moment and kill the enemy builder. In the gif below, blue builder picks up my knight teammate's bomb and kills me and the knight. 4.7 Playing with a knight friend Playing as an offensive builder+knight duo in public CTF matches in my opinion is one of the best ways to experience KAG. Since you don't have to rely on random people you can play much better and win stalemates by teamwork, as long as your knight defends you and supports you as much as they can: follows you, catches enemy bombs so that they don't damage you, gives you materials from enemy builders and helps you during doorfights. Besides launching yourself from a catapult in a crate held by a knight, as mentioned earlier, your knight friend can also bomb jump with you in a crate. If your knight friend drops resupply materials when respawning (changes to builder and back to knight), you'll also have more materials and be more effective at pushing.

They also have some text explanation of what I'm doing. King Arthur's Gold | Builder Gameplay with text analysis #1 King Arthur's Gold | Builder Gameplay with text analysis #2 - skipping mid King Arthur's Gold | Builder Gameplay with text analysis #3 - mid control (the third one was inspired by The_Osz's mid control video) 5.2 Miscellanous mechanics 5.2.1 Using number keys to buy items in menus You can use number buttons (1-9) to buy an item in a shop instead of clicking on it with your mouse. The number depends on the position of an item's in the shop. For example, you can buy mines in the knight shop by just opening the menu and pressing 3, you can buy a drill from the builder shop by pressing 7, you can buy a burger from food shop by pressing 4, etc. This can be faster than clicking the items with your cursor, so I recommend learning this. You can also use number keys to convert empty workshop to specific buildings. 5.2.2 Using bind modifier key + number keys to select blocks faster You can use the binding modifier key in controls (Left Shift by default) + 1-9 keys (press both at once) to select blocks faster. You can edit the block on each key in the Esc &gt; Bindings &gt; Bind Builder Blocks menu. 5.2.3 Picking up sharks If you want to pick up a shark, you first need to get the shark out of water, then sit on it (crouch on it) and then press W to pick it up. 5.2.4 Ladders in flag room As mentioned in the section 3.3.8 -- Getting to the flagroom, placing ladders prevents a block from being repaired. However, it also makes it hard to hit the block with the pickaxe. You can put ladders in your flag room like in the gif below. If the enemies don't have a drill, they will have trouble with destroying the blocks. Keep in mind that if the enemies WILL have a drill, they'll be able to easily drill through and you won't be able to repair the blocks. 5.2.5 Saw + crate trap Putting a saw and then a crate in front of it makes the saw not visible. Try to place the crate after the saw -- if you place a saw after placing the crate, the crate may get destroyed. Enemies may try to get on the crate but will die in the saw instead. 5.2.6 Pressing C while having a block selected Pressing C with a block in your hand deselects the block -- you need to select it again. You're also not able to build at all when having any item in your hand. "]]
